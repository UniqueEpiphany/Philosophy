### From Ladder to Treadmill

In 1858, the year Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace published the first plausible account of a mechanism for evolution, the Victorian brand of optimism known as ‘progress’ was in its prime. It is hardly surprising that Darwin and Wallace were immediately interpreted as having given succour to the god of progress. Evolution’s immediate popularity (and it was popular) owed much to the fact that it was misunderstood as a theory of steady progress from amoeba to man, a ladder of self-improvement.

As the end of the second millennium approaches mankind is in a different mood. Progress, he thinks, is about to hit the buffers of overpopulation, the greenhouse effect and the exhaustion of resources. However fast we run, we never seem to get anywhere. Has the industrial revolution made the average inhabitant of the world healthier, wealthier and wiser? Uncannily (or, as a philosopher would have us believe, predictably) evolutionary science is ready to suit the mood. The fashion in evolutionary science is now to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladder.

### Pregnant Virgins

For people, sex is the only way to have babies and that, plainly enough, is its purpose. It was only in the last half of the nineteenth century that anybody saw a problem with this. The problem was that there seemed to be all sorts of better ways of reproducing. Microscopic animals split in two. Willow trees grow from cuttings. Dandelions produce seeds that are clones of themselves. Virgin greenfly give birth to virgin young that are already pregnant with other virgins. August Weismann saw this clearly in 1889. ‘The significance of amphimixis [sex],’ he wrote, ‘cannot be that of making multiplication possible, for multiplication may be effected without amphimixis in the most diverse ways – by division of the organism into two or more, by budding, and even by the production of unicellular germs.

### Of Sex and Free Trade

A brief genetic glossary is necessary before we proceed. Genes are biochemical recipes written in an alphabet of four letters called DNA, recipes for how to make and run a body. A normal human being has two copies of each of 75,000 genes in every cell in his or her body. The total complement of 150,000 human genes is called the genome and the genes live on 23 pairs of ribbon-like objects called chromosomes. When a man impregnates a woman, each one of his sperm contains one copy of each gene, 75,000 in all, on 23 chromosomes. These are added to the 75,000 single genes on 23 chromosomes in the woman’s egg to make a complete human embryo with 75,000 pairs of genes and 23 pairs of chromosomes.

One more technical term is essential: meiosis, which is simply the procedure by which the male selects the genes that will go into a sperm, or the female selects the genes that will go into an egg. The man may choose either the 75,000 genes he inherited from his father, or the 75,000 he inherited from his mother, or, more likely, a mixture. During meiosis something peculiar happens. Each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes is laid alongside its opposite number. Chunks of one set are swapped with chunks of the other in a procedure called __recombination__. One whole set is then passed on to the offspring to be married with a set from the other parent: a procedure known as __outcrossing__.

Sex is recombination plus outcrossing: this mixing of genes is its principal feature. The consequence is that the baby gets a thorough mixture of his four grandparents’ genes (because of recombination) via his two parents (because of outcrossing). Between them, recombination and outcrossing are the essential procedures of sex. Everything else about it – gender, mate choice, incest avoidance, polygamy, love, jealousy – are all ways of doing outcrossing and recombination more effectively or carefully.

None the less, Weismann’s followers, and especially Sir Ronald Fisher and Hermann Müller, could escape the teleology trap by arguing that evolution, if not preordained, was at least essential. Asexual species were at a disadvantage and would fail in competition with sexual species. By incorporating the concept of the gene into Weismann’s argument, Fisher’s book in 19308 and Muller’s in 19329 laid out a seemingly watertight argument for the advantages of sex, and Müller even went so far as to declare the problem emphatically solved by the new science of genetics. Sexual species shared their newly invented genes among all individuals, asexual ones did not. So sexual species were like groups of inventors pooling their resources. If one man invented a steam engine and another a railway, then the two could come together. Asexual ones behaved like groups of jealous inventors who never shared their knowledge, so that steam locomotives were used on roads and horses dragged carts along railways.

In 1965, James Crow and Motoo Kimura modernized the Fisher–Müller logic by demonstrating with mathematical models how rare mutations could come together in sexual species but not in asexual ones. The sexual species does not have to wait for two rare events in the same individual but can combine them from different individuals. This, they said, would grant the sexual species an advantage over the asexual ones, so long as there were at least one thousand individuals in the sexual ones. All was hunky dory. Sex was explained, as an aid to evolution, and modern mathematics was adding new precision. The case could be considered closed.

### Mankind’s Greatest Rival is Mankind

When the fittest are struggling to survive, with whom are they competing? With other members of their species, or with members of other species?

A gazelle on the African savannah is trying not to be eaten by cheetahs, but it is also trying to outrun other gazelles when a cheetah attacks. What matters to the gazelle is being faster than other gazelles, not being faster than cheetahs. (There is an old story of a philosopher who runs when a bear charges him and his friend. ‘It’s no good, you’ll never outrun a bear,’ says the logical friend. ‘I don’t have to,’ replies the philosopher, ‘I only have to outrun you.’) In the same way, psychologists sometimes wonder why people are endowed with the ability to learn the part of Hamlet, or understand calculus, when neither skill was of much use to mankind in the primitive conditions where his intellect was shaped. Einstein would probably have been as hopeless as anybody in working out how to catch a woolly rhinoceros. Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems, but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding people’s motives, manipulating people – these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are, but how much cleverer and craftier than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species.

Now this may seem a false dichotomy. After all, the best thing an individual animal can do for its species is to survive and breed. Often, however, the two imperatives will be in conflict. Suppose the individual is a tigress whose territory has recently been invaded by another tigress. Does she welcome the intruder and discuss how best they can cohabit the territory, sharing prey? No, she fights her to the death, which from the point of view of the species is unhelpful. Or suppose the individual is an eaglet of a rare species anxiously watched by conservationists in its nest. Eaglets often kill their younger brothers and sisters in the nest. Good for the individual, bad for the species.

Throughout the world of animals, individuals are fighting individuals, whether of the same species or of another. And indeed, the closest competitor a creature is ever likely to meet is a member of its own species. Natural selection is not going to pick genes that help gazelles survive as a species but hurt the chances of individuals – because such genes will be wiped out long before they can show their benefits. Species are not fighting species, as nations battle other nations.

Wynne-Edwards believed fervently that animals often did things for the species, or at least for the group in which they lived. For example, he thought that sea birds chose not to breed when their numbers were high in order to prevent too much pressure on the food supply. The result of his book was that two factions formed: the group selectionists, who argued that much of animal behaviour was informed by the interests of the group not the individual, and the individual selectionists, who argued that individual interests always triumphed. The group selectionist argument is inherently appealing – we are immersed in the ethic of team spirit and charity. It also seemed to explain animal altruism. Bees die as they sting, trying to save the hive; birds warn each other of predators or help to feed their young siblings; even human beings are prepared to die in acts of selfless heroism, to save others’ lives. But, as we shall see, the appearance is misleading. Animal altruism is a myth; even in the most spectacular cases of selflessness, it turns out that animals are serving the selfish interests of their own genes – if sometimes being careless with their bodies.
