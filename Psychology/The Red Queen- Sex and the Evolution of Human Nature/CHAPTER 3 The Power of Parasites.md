### The Art of Being Slightly Different

In 1966, George Williams exposed the logical flaw at the heart of the textbook explanation of sex. He showed how it required animals to ignore short-term self-interest in order to further the survival and evolution of their species, a form of self-restraint that could only have evolved under very peculiar circumstances. He was very unsure what to put in its place. But he noticed that sex and dispersal often seem to be linked. Thus, grass grows asexual runners to propagate locally, but commits its sexually produced seeds to the wind to travel further. Sexual aphids grow wings; asexual ones do not. The suggestion that immediately follows is that if your young are going to have to travel abroad, then it is better that they vary, because abroad may not be like home.

Elaborating that idea was the main activity of ecologists interested in sex throughout the 1970s. In 1971, in his first attack on the problem, John Maynard Smith suggested that sex was needed for those cases in which two different creatures migrate into a new habitat in which it helps to combine both their characters. Two years later Williams returned to the fray and suggested that if most of the young are going to die, as most who try their luck as travellers will, then it may be the very fittest ones that will survive. It therefore matters not one jot how many young of average quality a creature has. What counts is having a handful of young that are exceptional. If you want your son to become pope, the best way to achieve this is not to have lots of identical sons, but to have lots of different sons in the hope that one is good, clever and religious enough.

The common analogy for what Williams was describing is a lottery. Breeding asexually is like having lots of lottery tickets all with the same number. To stand a chance of winning the lottery you need lots of different tickets. Therefore sex is useful to the individual, as well as the species, when the offspring are likely to face changed or unusual conditions.

### The Tangled Bank

Bell’s verdict on the lottery model was scathing: "Accepted, at least as a conceptual foundation, by the best minds which have contemplated the function of sexuality, it seems utterly to fail the test of comparative analysis."

Lottery models predict that sex should be commonest where in fact it is rarest – among highly fecund, small creatures in changeable environments. On the contrary, here sex is the exception; but in big, long-lived, slow-breeding creatures in stable environments sex is the rule.

Graham Bell has called this the ‘tangled bank’ theory, after the famous last paragraph of Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species: "It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us."

It is hard to find dedicated enthusiasts of tangled banks these days. Their main trouble is a familiar one: if it ain’t broke, why does sex need to fix it? An oyster that has grown large enough to breed is a great success, in oyster terms. Most of its siblings are dead. If, as tangled bankers assume, the genes had something to do with that, then why must we automatically assume that the combination of genes that won in this generation will be a flop in the next? There are ways round this difficulty for tangled bankers, but they sound a bit like special pleading. It is easy enough to identify an individual case where sex would have some advantage, but to raise it to a general principle for every habitat of every mammal and bird, for every coniferous tree, a principle that can give a big enough advantage to overcome the fact that asex is twice as fecund as sex – nobody can quite bring himself to do that.

### The Red Queen

One day in 1973, before his beard was so grey, Van Valen was searching his capacious mind for a phrase to express a new discovery he had made while studying marine fossils. The discovery was that the probability that a family of animals will become extinct does not depend on how long that family has already existed. In other words, species do not get better at surviving (nor do they grow feeble with age, as individuals do). Their chances of extinction are random.

The significance of this discovery had not escaped Van Valen, for it represented a vital truth about evolution that Darwin had not wholly appreciated. The struggle for existence never gets easier. However well a species may adapt to its environment, it can never relax, because its competitors and its enemies are also adapting to their niches. Survival is a zero-sum game. Success only makes one species a more tempting target for another rival species. Van Valen’s mind went back to his childhood and lit upon the living chess pieces that Alice encountered beyond the looking glass. The Red Queen is a formidable woman who runs like the wind but never seems to get anywhere.

A new evolutionary law’, wrote Van Valen and sent a manuscript to each of the most prestigious scientific journals in turn – only to see it rejected. Yet his claim was justified. The Red Queen has become a great personage in the biological court. And nowhere has she won a greater reputation than in theories of sex.

__Red Queen theories hold that the world is competitive to the death. It does keep changing. But did we not just hear that species are static for many generations and do not change? Yes. The point about the Red Queen is that she runs, but stays in the same place. The world keeps coming back to where it started; change there is, but not progress.__

__Sex, according to the Red Queen theory, has nothing to do with adapting to the inanimate world – becoming bigger, or better camouflaged, or more tolerant of cold, or better at flying – but is all about combating the enemy that fights back.__

Biologists have persistently overestimated the importance of physical causes of premature death rather than biological ones. In virtually any account of evolution, drought, frost, wind, or starvation loom large as the enemies of life. The great struggle, we are told, is to adapt to these conditions. Marvels of physical adaptation – the camel’s hump, the polar bear’s fur, the rotifer’s boil-resistant tun – are held to be among evolution’s greatest achievements. The first ecological theories of sex were all directed at explaining this adaptability to the physical environment. But with the tangled bank, a different theme has begun to be heard, and in the Red Queen’s march it is the dominant tune. The things that kill animals or prevent them reproducing are only rarely physical factors. Far more often they are other creatures – parasites, predators and competitors. A water flea that is starving in a crowded pond is the victim not of food shortage but of competition. Predators and parasites probably cause most of the world’s deaths, directly or indirectly. When a tree falls in the forest, it has usually been weakened by a fungus. When a herring meets its end it is usually in the mouth of a bigger fish or a net. What killed your ancestors two centuries or more ago? Smallpox, tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonia, plague, scarlet fever, diarrhoea. Starvation or accidents may have weakened people, but infection killed them. A few of the wealthier ones died of old age, or cancer, or heart attacks, but not many.

Again and again in recent years, evolutionary biologists have found themselves returning to the theme of parasites. As Richard Dawkins put it in a recent paper: " Eavesdrop [over] morning coffee at any major centre of evolutionary theory today, and you will find ‘parasite’ to be one of the commonest words in the language. Parasites are touted as the prime movers in the evolution of sex, promising a final solution to that problem of problems.

Parasites have a deadlier effect than predators for two reasons. One is that there are more of them. Human beings have no predators except great white sharks and each other, but they have lots of parasites. Even rabbits, which are eaten by stoats, weasels, foxes, buzzards, dogs and people, are host to far more fleas, lice, ticks, mosquitoes, tapeworms, and uncounted varieties of protozoa, bacteria, fungi and viruses. The myxomatosis virus has killed far more rabbits than foxes have. The second reason, which is the cause of the first, is that parasites are usually smaller than their hosts while predators are usually larger. This means that the parasites live shorter lives and pass through more generations in a given time than their hosts. The bacteria in your gut pass through six times as many generations during your lifetime as people have passed through since they were apes.26 As a consequence, they can multiply faster than their hosts and control or reduce the host population. The predator merely follows the abundance of its prey.

Parasites and their hosts are locked in a close evolutionary embrace. The more successful the parasite’s attack (the more hosts it infects or the more resources it gets from each), the more the host’s chances of survival will depend on whether it can invent a defence. The better the host defends, the more natural selection will promote the parasites that can overcome the defence. So the advantage will always be swinging from one to the other: the more dire the emergency for one, the better it will fight. This is truly the world of the Red Queen, where you never win, you only gain a temporary respite.
