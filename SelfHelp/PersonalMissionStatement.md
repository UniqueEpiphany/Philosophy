Succeed at home first.  
Seek and merit divine help.  
Never compromise with honesty.  
Remember the people involved.  
Hear both sides before judging.  
Obtain counsel of others.  
Defend those who are absent.  
Be sincere yet decisive.  
Develop one new proficiency a year.  
Plan tomorrow's work today.  
Hustle while you wait.  
Maintain a positive attitude.  
Keep a sense of humor.  
Be orderly in person and in work.  
Do not fear mistakes -- fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to
those mistakes.  
Facilitate the success of subordinates.  
Listen twice as much as you speak.  
Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or promotion.  
I will seek to balance career and family as best I can since both are important to me.  
My home will be a place where I and my family, friends, and guests find joy, comfort, peace, and happiness. Still I will seek to create a clean and orderly environment, yet livable and comfortable. I will exercise wisdom in what we choose to eat, read, see, and do at home. I especially want to teach my children to love, to learn, and to laugh -- and to work and develop their unique talents.  
I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society. I will be a concerned and informed citizen, involved in the political process to ensure my voice is heard and my vote is counted.  
I will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life's goals. I will act on situations and opportunities, rather than to be acted upon.  
I will always try to keep myself free from addictive and destructive habits. I will develop habits that free me from old labels and limits and expand my capabilities and choices.  
My money will be my servant, not my master. I will seek financial independence over time. My wants will be subject to my needs and my means. Except for long-term home and car loans, I will seek to keep myself free from consumer debt. I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part of my income.  
Moreover, I will use what money and talents I have to make life more enjoyable for others through service and charitable giving.
