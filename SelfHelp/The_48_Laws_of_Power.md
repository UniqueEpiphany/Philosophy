# LAW 1 : NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER

__Always make those above you feel comfortably supe o  In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the  posite-inspire fear and insecu ty. Make your masters appear more b lliant than th  are and you will attain the heights of power.__

### KEYS TO POWER

Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­ play your talents, you natur ly stir up all kinds of resen ent, envy, and other manifesta ons of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others . With those above you, however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.

This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­ vertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters who are more insecure than others, mons ously insecUfe; you may natu­ rally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace.

Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain hi  standing in life are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and  arm. It is a deadly but common mispercep on to believe that by displaying and vaunting YOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affec on. He may feign appreciation, but at his  rst opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis  V replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will not admit  e truth, but will  nd an excuse to rid hi self of YOUf presence.

Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want . Entire books could be written about favorites who fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine.

Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can tu  this Law to your advantage. First you must flatter and pu  up your master. Overt flattery can be e ec ve but h  its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and looks bad to other cour ers. Discreet  attery is much more power l. If you are more intelligent th  your master, for example, seem the opposite: Make hi  appear more intelligent th  you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his exper se. Commit harmless mist es that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the  ance to  k for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gi s of his experi­ ence may direct rancor  d ill will at you instead.

If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to hi , in as public a manner as possible. Make it cle  that your advice is merely an echo of his  advice.

If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court jester, but do not make hi appear cold and surly by comp ison. Tone down your humor if necessary, and nd ways to make hi seem the dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable and generous th your master, be care l not to be the cloud that blocks his radiance om o ers. He must appear as the sun around which everyone revolves, radia ng power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you are thrust into the position of entertaining hi , a display of your limited me s may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress hi with your grace and generosity can prove fatal: om Fouquet or pay the price.

In  l of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your s engths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a vic m of their insecurity. This will all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

The Stars in the Sky. There can be only one sun at a time. Never obscure the sunlight, or riyal the sun's brilliance; rather, fade into the sky and find ways to heighten the master star's intensity.Authority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious, but the superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal. This is a lesson that the stars in the sky teach us-they may be related to the sun, and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company.

### REVERSAL
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you co e across, but you must be selec vely cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful-your master had no su scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outs t hi at key moments. If he is ve weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course. Do not risk outshining a feeble superior-it ight appear cruel or spite l. But if your master is in his posi on, yet you know yourself to be the more capable, bide your me and be pa ent. It is the natural course of things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and so eday outshine him.

# LAW 2 NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES

Be wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. Th also become spoiled and tyrannnical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from ennemies. you have no enemies, find a way to make them.

It is natural  to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness. Besides, you know them. Why depend on a stranger when you have a  friend at hand?

The problem is that you often do not know your friends as weIl as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each  other's jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens  friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetyy, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes-maybe they mean it, often they do not.

When you decide to hire a  iend, you gradually discover the qualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve their good fortune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are deserving. There is almost a touch  of condescension in the act of hiring friends that secretly  aflicts  them. The injury will come out slowly: A little more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.

Ingratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers for so many centuries, that it is  truly amazing that people con nue to underestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude  from a friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.

The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you;  and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feelings.

 All  working situations require a kind of distance between people. You are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only obscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for  friendship, but work with  the skilled and competent.
 
 Your enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you must learn  to exploit.
 
 
 Without enemies  ound us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert. It is some times better, then, to use enemies as enemies rather than tansforming them into  friends or allies.Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to enhance his reputation as a surefooted  fighter who can  be relied upon in  times of uncertainty.
 
 > The Jaws of Ingratitude. Knowing what would happen if you put a finger In the mouth of a lion, you would stay
clear of it. With friends you will have no such caution, and if you hire them, they will eat you alive with ingratitude.Know how to use enemies for your own profit. You must learn to grab a sword not by its blade, which would cut you, but by the handle, which allows you to defend YOUfself. The wise man profits more from his enemies, than a fool from his friends.

### REVERSAL

Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there  aree  enimes when a friend can  be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the sake of apperrances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for  him;  friends often do this the best, since their affection for him  makes them willing to take chances. Also, if YOUf plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This "fall of the favorite" was a  trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that they would deliberately sacrifice a  friend for such a purpose. Of course,  after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to
reserve  scapegoat role for someone who isclose to you but not too close.

Fin ly, the problem about working with friends is that it con ses the bound ies and distances that working requires. But if both par ers in the    gement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em­ ployed to great e ect. You must never let YOUf guard down in su  a ven­  re, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional  sturb ce such as envy and ingra tude. Nothing is stable in the realm of power,  d even the dosest of friends can be  ansformed into the worst of
enemies.
