# LAW 1 : NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER

__Always make those above you feel comfortably supe o  In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the  posite-inspire fear and insecu ty. Make your masters appear more b lliant than th  are and you will attain the heights of power.__

### KEYS TO POWER

Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­ play your talents, you natur ly stir up all kinds of resen ent, envy, and other manifesta ons of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others . With those above you, however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.

This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­ vertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters who are more insecure than others, mons ously insecUfe; you may natu­ rally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace.

Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain hi  standing in life are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and  arm. It is a deadly but common mispercep on to believe that by displaying and vaunting YOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affec on. He may feign appreciation, but at his  rst opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis  V replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will not admit  e truth, but will  nd an excuse to rid hi self of YOUf presence.

Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want . Entire books could be written about favorites who fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine.

Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can tu  this Law to your advantage. First you must flatter and pu  up your master. Overt flattery can be e ec ve but h  its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and looks bad to other cour ers. Discreet  attery is much more power l. If you are more intelligent th  your master, for example, seem the opposite: Make hi  appear more intelligent th  you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his exper se. Commit harmless mist es that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the  ance to  k for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gi s of his experi­ ence may direct rancor  d ill will at you instead.

If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to hi , in as public a manner as possible. Make it cle  that your advice is merely an echo of h  advice.
