It depends what you are using speed reading for.  If it is to locate information, then yes.  If it is to comprehend and retain information, then no.  

The danger of speed-reading is that because of the way short term and long term memory interact during the working memory phase, people believe they are learning.  But two hours later, they have lost much of that information.

Academic study after academic study has found no benefit to reading comprehension and retention from speed reading.  In fact studies show dramatic losses of comprehension and retention when "reading" gets above 600 words per minute (an average reader is between 200-300 words per minute.  Adept readers can read up to 400 wpm).  Many of the "studies" cited by people that sell speed-reading as a product do not meet academic testing standards or are clearly manipulating the numbers.

Through training and practice, people with a 200 wpm speed can get to the point where ~350 wpm is comfortable and normal for them.  But all the marketing slogans that promise 1200 – 2000 words per minute are snake oil.

I was assigned to examine speed reading to see if it would benefit our training programs and decrease the time it takes to certify employees.  We gathered dozens of studies and found no convincing evidence that speed reading would benefit our employees.
