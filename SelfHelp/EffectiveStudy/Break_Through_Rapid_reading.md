# SAVE TIME BY STARTING TODAY

##### A GOOD READER IS A FLEXIBLE READER

Learning to read faster and more efficiently will not simply speed up your rate. You will be learning to read in a completely new way. When people ask me how fast I read 1 am noi able 10 answer with a single words per minute rate. It's comparable to asking a dri- ver how fast he can drive a car. He might answer that it depends on the condition of the car, the condition of the roads, the weather, the traffic, and his familiarity with the route. It would also depend on how compelling it is to get to his destination.

Like this driver, the efficient reader varies his or her rate according to the difficulty of the material, the organization of the reading matter, their familiarity with the subject, and their purpose in reading it. So instead of reading everything the same way, starting at the beginning and going word-by-word straight through to the end. you will learn many different ways to read, and how to adapt each one to meet your specific purpose in reading the material.


# START USING YOUR BUILT-IN READING ACCELERATOR

##### WHAT YOUR EYES DO WHEN YOU READ

Before you learn how to read with your hand, you should know why you read slowly. And first you must know something about how your eyes work when you read. The eyes are constantly moving around in little jerky movements. In order to see something, it is necessary for them to stop and fixate on an object for a brief moment in order to register an impression. It's somewhat like taking a picture with a camera.

We have all been taught to read one word at a time, which means a rate of about 240 words per minute. This is because your eyes need a quarter of a second to fixate on an object. Therefore, if you read one word at a time, as you were taught to do, you read one word every quarter of a second. With a little easy arithmetic, that comes to four words per second or a rate of 240 words per minute.

##### REGRESSIONS SLOW YOUR RATE CONSIDERABLY

More than likely, you read fewer than 240 words per minute. The average reader makes many regressions, going back and looking at words, 10 to 11 times for every 100 words read. This means that the average reading rate is about 215 words per
minute.

There are two kinds of regression, conscious and unconscious. You may sometimes feel that you dtd not understand something particularly well, so you decide to go back and reread it. This is a conscious regression and there is nothing particularly wrong with it. It is not the most efficient way to get the best comprehension, but it is certainly one way.

Unconscious regressions exist because poor habits were formed when you first learned to read. They occur when the eyes, unconsciously, go back and look at words. You will learn how to eliminate this habit shortly and immediately increase your reading rate because of it. Even if you arc reading faster than 240 words per minute, you probably make some regressions. Learning to eliminate them is the first step in learning to read faster.

##### WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT READING CONDITIONS
There arc two things you should know about reading conditions: what lighting you should have and the best position, or posture, for reading.

Did your mother ever say to you. "There's not enough light there, you 11 ruin your eyes!" when you were absorbed in reading something? Us possible that your mother was mistaken because Americans tend to overhght on the whole. You should have light- ing that is neither too bright nor too dim; either one can be a strain on your eyes.

The best lighting for reading is diffused lighting, or lighting that comes from sev- eral sources and does not create a glare on the page. If you can read the material with- out any strain, then there is probably enough light. Too much or too little light can cause a strain. A good test is to put your hand about a foot above your reading mater- ial. If there is a strong, sharp shadow then the light is too bright. It is preferable to have almost no shadow at all. Small high-intensity lamps are not advisable.


##### READING POSITIONS

Many people will not like to find out that the best position for reading is silting up in a chair with your back firmly against the back of it. Slouching, lying down, and other alternative reading positions are simply not the best way to read.
Sometimes correcting your posture is uncomfortable at first, but if you are truly interested in efficiency, then you would do well to make this a permanent habit.

##### HOW TO USE YOUR HAND IN READING

To use your hand to increase your reading rate, begin by pointing your index finger as in Figure 2. Then run the tip of your finger along each line of print just underneath the words you are reading. As your finger moves along, read above it. When your finger comes to the end of the line, lift it up about half an inch and bring it quickly back to the following line and begin the whole process again.

Although this may at first seem a bit awkward, you will quickly get used to it. And almost as soon as you begin using your hand when you read, you will start increasing your rate. That's because it helps you to eliminate unconscious regressions. In fact, doing this alone helps the average person speed up from 10% to 20%. But it will take some practice to achieve that Here are some exercises to help you begin.


When you have spent a few minutes on Exercise No. 2, then you should be ready to begin using your hand to read. __This is a very important step because from this moment on you should use your hand for all of your reading, especially while you are learning this skill. It is vital to your success that the use of your hand becomes second nature to you while you are reading.__

Try to read as much as you can. using your hand, before you begin the next chap- ter. Ronald Vivio, a teacher who used to work with me. when emphasizing the impor- tance of reading everything with the hand as a pacer, would tell his students that there were to be no exceptions: when driving and approaching a stop sign, they must read it with their hand; when they went to a foreign movie, he would expect to see their hands also raised, moving along under the subtitles! Nowadays you can even add your com- puter screen to that list - if you can keep it clean, however. And these are not such far- fetched ideas. The student who takes the use of his hand seriously is well on his way to becoming a good and efficient reader.

# ELIMINATE REGRESSIONS AND SPEED AHEAD

##### ELIMINATING REGRESSIONS

If you've been using your hand to read, then youvc been experiencing reading with fewer regressions. You've also been developing a coordination of your eye movements with your hand movements. You should now be ready for some more work on elimi- nating regressions and starling to see more than one word at a time. This consists of an exercise in rereading a passage several times. When you drill by rereading, you help to eliminate regressions more quickly, since the mind can relax and not worry about miss- ing something: you've already read it. so you can learn to speed up very easily. When you know that you're not missing anything, you can begin to train your eyes to look at the words only once.

##### ALWAYS USE YOUR HAND

It constantly puzzles me that there is usually one student who tries to learn this skill without using his or her hand. Perhaps they've decided its a nuisance, or perhaps they're just lazy and doesn't want to be bothered. Occasionally, I suspect they think that they can do it better without their hands. If this is the case, then I can't understand why they paid to study with me.

In my opinion, trying to learn to read faster without using your hand is like try- ing to write faster without a computer. Certainly you can learn to write much faster without a computer, but with one—after learning how to use it—it's so much easier. The great part about using the hand to help you read faster is that you always have it with you.
