# CHAPTER 1 Investment versus Speculation: Results to Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor

> “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom- ises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”

In most periods the investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his common-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog- ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.

Outright speculation is neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub- stantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1) speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri- ously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose.

In our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates on margin† should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating, and it is his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling.

### Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor

We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component; that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion between the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock component to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,” and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he felt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly attractive.”


We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.The contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. __The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.__  Aggressive investors may buy other types of common stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab- lished by intelligent analysis.

To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen- tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might also utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or, if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest- ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration of his investment program along standard lines. The third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak- ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as “formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug- gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela- tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later chapters.

##### Results to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor

We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu- sion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.

The enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has various possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be identified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable standards.

## COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 1

Graham’s definition of investing could not be clearer: “An invest- ment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.” 1 Note that investing, according to Graham, consists equally of three elements:

* you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;  
* you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;  
* you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.  

Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.

People began believing that the test of an investment technique was simply whether it “worked.” If they beat the market over any period, no matter how dangerous or dumb their tactics, people boasted that they were “right.” But the intelligent investor has no inter- est in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be sustainably and reliably right.

# CHAPTER 2 The Investor and Inflation

This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s prices—or tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25 years for Gen- eral Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground lost in the 1929–1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor concentrates his portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This is particu- larly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur- ther inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he will take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as a chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a vindica- tion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low the dividend return. That way lies sorrow.

##### TWO ACRONYMS TO THE RESCUE
Fortunately, you can bolster your defenses against inflation by branch- ing out beyond stocks. Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters have become widely available to investors:

* REITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced “reets”), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial and residential properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds, REITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van- guard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund, and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give you some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without hampering your overall returns.

* TIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S. government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran- tee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In one easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the loss of purchasing power.
