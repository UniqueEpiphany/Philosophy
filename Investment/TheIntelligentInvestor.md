# CHAPTER 1 Investment versus Speculation: Results to Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor

> “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom- ises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”

In most periods the investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his common-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog- ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.

Outright speculation is neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub- stantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1) speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri- ously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose.

In our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates on margin† should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating, and it is his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling.

### Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor

We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component; that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion between the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock component to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,” and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he felt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly attractive.”


We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.The contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. __The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.__  Aggressive investors may buy other types of common stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab- lished by intelligent analysis.

To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen- tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might also utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or, if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest- ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration of his investment program along standard lines. The third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak- ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as “formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug- gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela- tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later chapters.
