### Tell me about yourself.

My first job was working as a Asp.net developer for a hedge fund consultaing company, which provides middle-office technical solutions and supports to our clients. It’s a very unique experience since other than developing tools to retrieve, aggregate and visualize data, I also need to meet and communicate with clients to understand their business requirements. 

From July 2014, I work as a software engineer at News-Distribution team in FactSet. News-Distribution team have two sub-teams, one is News-Searching, the other is News-Alerting, and I work at the News-Searching team.

My primary job here is to maintain News-Search Service, which is a HTTP service that take search requests and return financial information to clients. You can basically think News-Search Service is a specialized search engine for financial professionals. However, we manage the service and its related API only, our direct consumers are FactSet front-end applications, e.g. FactSet workstation and other Web applications. Basically, most(if not all) full text search requests those front-end applications received from clients will be forward to our News-Search service.

I have working experience with both back-end and front-end technologies though I am more interested in back-end. I have  three years of C++ and linux working experience and I have solid knowledge about software development and operating system. I also have general financial knowledge since I have been worked in financial industry for 5 years.  I am looking for a back-end developer position.
