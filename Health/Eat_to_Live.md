* Recommand book : Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss -- by Joel Fuhrman 

# Introduction

Scientific studies show a clear and strong relationship between cancers of the digestive tract, bladder, and prostate with low fruit consumption. 


These results sound fantastic, and they are — but they are also true and predictable on my program. The key to this extraordinary diet is a simple formula: 

```
H = N/C.
Health = Nutrients/Calories
```

__Your health is predicted by your nutrient intake divided by your intake of calories.__

H = N/C is a concept I call the __nutrient-density__ of your diet. Food supplies us with both nutrients and calories (energy). __All calories come from only three elements: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.__ ___Nutrients are derived from noncaloric food factors — including vitamins, minerals, fibers, and phytochemicals. These noncaloric nutrients are vitally important for health.__ Your key to permanent weight loss is to eat predominantly those foods that have a high proportion of nutrients (noncaloric food factors) to calories (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins). In physics a key formula is Einstein's E = mc . In nutrition the key formula is H = N/C.

Every food can be evaluated using this formula. Once you begin to learn which foods make the grade — by having a high proportion of nutrients to calories — you are on your way to lifelong weight control and improved health.

Eating large quantities of high-nutrient foods is the secret to op- timal health and permanent weight control. In fact, eating much larger portions of food is one of the beauties of the Eat to Live diet. You eat more, which effectively blunts your appetite, and you lose weight — permanently.

The Eat to Live diet does not require any deprivation. In fact, you do not have to give up any foods completely. However, as you con- sume larger and larger portions of health-supporting, high-nutrient foods, your appetite for low-nutrient foods decreases and you grad- ually lose your addiction to them. You will be able to make a com- plete commitment to this diet for the rest of your life.

# Digging Our Graves with Forks and Knives THE EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN DIET, PART I

People whose parents are obese have a tenfold increased risk of being obese. On the other hand, obese families tend to have obese pets, which is obviously not genetic. So it is the combination of food choices, inactivity, and genetics that determines obesity.

Obesity is not just a cosmetic issue — extra weight leads to an earlier death, as many studies confirm. Overweight individuals are more likely to die from all causes, including heart disease and cancer. Two-thirds of those with weight problems also have hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or another obesity-related condition.

```
Health Complications of Obesity
Increased overall premature mortality • Adult onset diabetes
* Hypertension
* Degenerative arthritis
* Coronary artery disease 
* Cancer
* Lipid disorders
* Obstructive sleep apnea 
* Gallstones
* Fatty infiltration of liver
* Restrictive lung disease
* Gastrointestinal diseases
```

It is for this simple yet much overlooked reason: for the vast majority of people, being overweight is not caused by how much they eat but by what they eat. The idea that people get heavy because they consume a high volume of food is a myth. Eating large amounts of the right food is your key to success and is what makes this plan workable for the rest of your life. What makes many people over- weight is not that they eat so much more but that they get a higher percentage of their calories from fat and refined carbohydrates, or mostly low-nutrient foods. This low-nutrient diet establishes a favor- able cellular environment for disease to flourish.

In studies on identical twins with the tendency to be overweight, scientists found that physical activity is the strongest environmental determinant of total body and central abdominal fat mass. Even those with a strong family history of obesity effectively lose weight with increased physical activity and appropriate dietary modifications.

Most of the time, the reason people are overweight is too little physical activity, in conjunction with a high-calorie. low-nutrient diet. Eating a diet with plenty of low-fiber, calorie-dense food, such as oil and refined carbohydrates, is the main culprit.

Dr. I-Min Lee, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said her twenty-seven-year study of 19,297 men found there was no such thing as being too thin. Among men who never smoked, the lowest mortality occurred in the lightest fifth.Those who were in the thinnest 20 percent in the early 1960s were two and a half times less likely to have died of cardiovascular disease by 1988 than those in the heaviest fifth. Lee stated, "We observed a di- rect relationship between body weight and mortality. By that I mean that the thinnest fifth of men experienced the lowest mortality, and mortality increased progressively with heavier and heavier weight."

##### The Longer Your Waistline, the Shorter Your Lifeline 

As a good rule of thumb: for optimal health and longevity, a man should not have more than one-half inch of skin that he can pinch near his umbilicus (belly button) and a woman should not have more than one inch. Almost any fat on the body over this minimum is a health risk. If you have gained even as little as ten pounds since the age of eighteen or twenty, then you could be at significant in- creased risk for health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The truth is that most people who think they are at the right weight still have too much fat on their body.

##### The Only Way to Significantly Increase Life Span


The evidence for increasing one's life span through dietary restriction is enormous and irrefutable. Reduced caloric intake is the only ex- perimental technique to consistently extend maximum life span. This has been shown in all species tested, from insects and fish to rats and cats. 

High-nutrient, low-calorie eating results in dramatic increases in life span as well as prevention of chronic illnesses. From rodents to primates we see:

```
* Resistance to experimentally induced cancers
* Protection from spontaneous and genetically predisposed
* A delay in the onset of late-life diseases
* Nonappearance of atherosclerosis and diabetes
* Lower cholesterol and triglycerides and increased HDL 
* Improved insulin sensitivity
* Enhancement of the energy-conservation mechanism, includ- ing reduced body temperature
* Reduction in oxidative stress
* Reduction in parameters of cellular aging, including cellular congestion
* Enhancement of cellular repair mechanisms, including DNA repair enzymes
* Reduction in inflammatory response and immune cell proliferation
* Improved defenses against environmental stresses
* Suppression of the genetic alterations associated with aging 
* Protection of genes associated with removal of oxygen radicals 
* Inhibited production of metabolites that are potent cross-linking agents
* Slowed metabolic rate
```

The link between thinness and longevity, and obesity and a shorter life span, is concrete. Another important consideration in other animal studies is that fat restriction has an additional effect on lengthening life span. Apparently, higher-fat intake promotes hormone production, speeds up reproductive readiness and other indicators of aging, and promotes the growth of certain tumors.

##### To Avoid Overeating on High-Calorie Foods, Fill Up on Nutrient-Rich Ones

An important corollary to the principle of limiting high-calorie food is that the only way for a human being to safely achieve the benefits of caloric restriction while ensuring that the diet is nutritionally ade- quate is to avoid as much as possible those foods that are nutrient poor.


Indeed, this is the crucial consideration in deciding what to eat. __We need to eat foods with adequate nutrients so we won't need to consume excess "empty" calories to reach our nutritional requirements. Eating foods that are rich in nutrients and fiber, and low in calories, "fills us up," so to speak, thus preventing us from overeating.__

To grasp why this works, let us look at how the brain controls our dietary drive. A complicated system of chemoreceptors in the nerves lining the digestive tract carefully monitor the calorie and nutrient density of every mouthful and send such information to the hypo- thalamus in the brain, which controls dietary drive.

There are also stretch receptors in the stomach to signal satiety by detecting the *volume* of food eaten, not the *weight* of the food. If you are not filled up with nutrients and fiber, the brain will send out signals telling you to eat more food, or overeat.

In fact, if you consume sufficient nutrients and fiber, you will become *biochemically* filled (__nutrients__) and *mechanically* filled (__fiber__), and your desire to consume calories will be blunted or turned down. One key factor that determines whether you will be overweight is your failure to consume sufficient fiber and nutrients. This has been illustrated in scientific studies.

Liquid calories, without the fiber present in the whole food, have little effect at blunting our caloric drive. Studies show that fruit juice and other sweet beverages lead to obesity in children as well.

If you are serious about losing weight, don't drink your fruit, eat it. Too much fiber and too many nutrients are removed during juicing, and many of the remaining nutrients are lost through processing, heat, and storage time. If you are not overweight, drinking fresh-prepared juice is acceptable as long as it does not serve as a substitute for eating those fresh fruits and vegetables. There is no substitute for natural whole foods.

### What if I Have a Slow Metabolic Rate?

Your body weight may be affected slightly by genetics, but that effect is not strong. __Furthermore, I am convinced that inheriting a slow metabolic rate with a tendency to gain weight is not a flaw or defect but rather a genetic gift that can be taken advantage of. How is this possible? A slower metabolism is associated with longer life span in all species of animals.__ 

As you can see, it is not always bad to have a slow metabolic rate. It can be good. Sure, it is bad in today's environment of relentless eating and when consuming a high-calorie, low-nutrient diet. Sure, it will increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease and cancer, given today's food-consumption patterns. __However, if correct food choices are made to maintain a normal weight, the individual with a slower metabolism may age more slowly.__

Our body is like a machine. If we constantly run the machinery at high speed, it will wear out faster. Since animals with slower metabolic rates live longer, eating more calories, which drives up our metabolic rate, will cause us only to age faster. Contrary to what you may have heard and read in the past, our goal should be the opposite: to eat less, only as much as we need to maintain a slim and muscular weight, and no more, so as to keep our metabolic rate relatively slow.


So stop worrying about your slower metabolic rate. A slower metabolic rate from dieting is not the primary cause of your weight problem. Keep these three important points in mind:
1. Resting metabolic rates do decline slightly during periods of lower caloric intake, but not enough to significantly inhibit weight loss.
2. Resting metabolic rates return to normal soon after caloric in- take is no longer restricted. The lowered metabolic rate does not stay low permanently and make future dieting more difficult.
3. A sudden lowering of the metabolic rate from dieting does not explain the weight gain/loss cycles experienced by many over-weight people. These fluctuations in weight are primarily from going on and getting off diets. It is especially difficult to stay with a reduced-calorie diet when it never truly satisfies the individual's biochemical need for nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals.

__Those with a genetic tendency to overweight may actually have the genetic potential to outlive the rest of us.__ The key to their successful longevity lies in their choosing a nutrient-rich, fiber-rich, lower- calorie diet, as well as getting adequate physical activity. By adjusting the nutrient-per-calorie density of your diet to your metabolic rate, you can use your slow metabolism to your advantage. When you can maintain a normal weight in spite of a slow metabolism, you will be able to achieve significant longevity.


#  Overfed, Yet Malnourished THE EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN DIET, PART II


##### The Pros and Cons of Our "Natural Sweet Tooth"

__Fruit is an essential part of our diets. It is an indispensable requirement for us to maintain a high level of health. Fruit consumption has been shown in numerous studies to offer our strongest protection against certain cancers, especially oral and esophageal, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Thankfully, our natural sweet tooth directs us to those foods ideally "designed" for our primate her- itage — fruit. Fresh fruit offers us powerful health-giving benefits.__


Researchers have discovered substances in fruit that have unique effects on preventing aging and deterioration of the brain. Some fruits, especially blueberries, are rich in anthocyanins and other compounds having anti-aging effects. Studies continue to provide evidence that more than any other food, fruit consumption is associated with lowered mortality from all cancers combined. Eating fruit is vital to your health, well-being, and long life. 


#####  Nutritional Lightweights: Pasta and White Bread

Unlike the fruits found in nature — which have a full ensemble of nutrients — processed carbohydrates (such as bread, pasta, and cake) are deficient in fiber, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, all of which have been lost in processing.

Medical investigations clearly show the dangers of consuming the quantity of processed foods that we do. And because these re- fined grains lack the fiber and nutrient density to turn down our appetite, they also cause obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and significantly increased cancer risk.

Summarizing fifteen epidemiological studies, researchers concluded that diets containing refined grains and refined sweets were consis- tently linked to stomach and colon cancer, and at least twelve breast cancer studies connect low-fiber diets with increased risks.

Eating diet that contains a significant quantity of sugar and refined flour does not just cause weight gain, it also leads to an earlier death.

If you want to lose weight, the most important foods to avoid arc processed foods: condiments, candy, snacks, and baked goods; fat- free has nothing to do with it. Almost all weight-loss authorities agree on this — you must cut out the refined carbohydrates, includ- ing bagels, pasta, and bread. As far as the human body is concerned, low-fiber carbohydrates such as pasta are almost as damaging as white sugar. Pasta is not health food — it is hurt food.

##### Soil Depletion of Nutrients Is Not the Problem- Our Food Choices Are

It is not merely dental cavities that should concern us about sugar. If we allow ourselves and our children to utilize sugar, white- flour products, and oil to supply the majority of calories, as most American families do, we shall be condemning ourselves to a lifetime of sickness, medical problems, and a premature death.

__Refined sugars include table sugar (sucrose), milk sugar (lactose), honey, brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, molasses, corn sweeteners, and fruit juice concentrates. Even the bottled and boxed fruit juices that many children drink are a poor food; with no significant nutrient density, they lead to obesity and disease. Processed apple juice, which is not far from sugar water in its nutrient score, accounts for almost 50 percent of all fruit servings consumed by preschoolers.
For example, apple juice contains none of the vitamin C originally present in the whole apple. Oranges make the most nutritious juice, but even orange juice can't compare with the original orange. In citrus fruits, most of the anti-cancer compounds are present in the membranes and pulp, which are removed in processing juice. Those cardboard containers of orange juice contain less than 10 percent of the vitamin C present in an orange and even less of the fiber and phytochemicals. Juice is not fruit, and prepackaged juices do not con- tain even one-tenth of the nutrients present in fresh fruit.__

##### Processed carbohydrates, lacking in fiber, fail to slow sugar absorption, causing wide swings in glucose levels.

Empty calories are empty calories. Cookies, jams, and other pro- cessed foods (even those from the health-food store) sweetened with "fruit juice" sound healthier but are just as bad as white-sugar prod- ucts. When fruit juice is concentrated and used as a sweetener, the healthy nutritional components are stripped away — what's left is plain sugar. To your body, there is not much difference between refined sugar, fruit juice sweeteners, honey, fruit juice concentrate, or any other concentrated sweetener. Our sweet tooth has been put there by nature to have us enjoy and consume real fruit, not some imitation. Fresh-squeezed orange juice and other fresh fruit and veg- etable juices are relatively healthy foods that contain the majority of the original vitamins and minerals. But the sweet fruit juices and even carrot juice should still be used only moderately, as they still contain a high concentration of sugar calories and no fiber. Still not an ideal food for those desiring to lose weight. I often use these juices as part of salad dressings and other dishes rather than alone as a drink. __Fresh fruits and even dried fruits do contain an assortment of protective nutrients and phytochemicals, so stick with the real thing.__

##### Enrichment with Nutrients Is a House Made of Straw

White or "enriched" rice is just as bad as white bread and pasta. It is nutritionally bankrupt.Refining the rice removes the same im- portant factors: fiber, minerals, phytochemicals, and vitamin E. So, when you eat grains, eat whole grains.Refining foods removes so much nutrition that our government requires that a few synthetic vitamins and minerals be added back.As we change food through processing and refining, we rob the food of certain health-supporting substances and often create un- healthy compounds, thus making it a more unfit food for human consumption. __As a general rule of thumb: the closer we eat foods to their natural state, the healthier the food.__

##### Not All Whole-Wheat Products Are Equal

__Eating fragmented and unbalanced foods causes many problems, espe- cially for those trying to lose weight.__ 
Whole-grain hot cereals are less processed than cold cereals and come up with better nutritional scores. They can be soaked in water overnight so you do not have to cook them in the morning. Some hot whole-grain cereals that I recommend are oatmeal (not instant), Roman Meal, Steel Cut Oats, Wheatena, Ralston High Fiber, and Quaker Multigrain.

##### Fat and Refined Carbohydrates: Married to Your Waist

The body converts food fat into body fat quickly and easily: 100 calo- ries of ingested fat can be converted to 97 calories of body fat by burning a measly 3 calories. Fat is an appetite stimulant: the more you eat, the more you want. If a food could be scientifically engineered to create an obese society, it would have fat, such as butter, mixed with sugar and flour.

The combination of fat and refined carbohydrates has an ex- tremely powerful effect on driving the signals that promote fat accu- mulation on the body. Refined foods cause a swift and excessive rise in blood sugar, which in turn triggers insulin surges to drive the sugar out of the blood and into our cells. Unfortunately, insulin also promotes the storage of fat on the body and encourages your fat cells to swell.

As more fat is packed away on the body, it interferes with insulin uptake into our muscle tissues. Our pancreas then senses that the glucose level in the bloodstream is still too high and pumps out even more insulin. A little extra fat around our midsection results in so much interference with insulin's effectiveness that two to five times as much insulin may be secreted in an overweight person than in a thin person.

The higher level of insulin in turn promotes more efficient con- version of our caloric intake into body fat, and this vicious cycle con- tinues. People get heavier and heavier as time goes on.

Eating refined carbohydrates — as opposed to complex carbohy- drates in their natural state — causes the body's "set point" for body weight to increase. Your "set point" is the weight the body tries to maintain through the brain's control of hormonal messengers. When you eat refined fats (oils) or refined carbohydrates such as white flour and sugar, the fat-storing hormones are produced in excess, raising the set point. To further compound the problem, because so much of the vitamin and mineral content of these foods has been lost during processing, you naturally crave more food to make up for the missing nutrients.

##### Our Oil-Rich Country, or FromYour Lips Right to Your Hips

__Fat, such as olive oil, can be stored on your body within minutes, without costing the body any caloric price; it is just packed away (un- changed) on your hips and waist. If we biopsied your waist fat and looked at it under an electron microscope, we could actually see where the fat came from. It is stored there as pig fat, dairy fat, and olive oil fat —just as it was in the original food. It goes from your lips right to your hips. Actually, more fat from your last meal is deposited around your waist than on your hips, for both men and women.__ Analyzing these body-fat deposits is an accurate way for research scientists to discern food intake over time. Having research subjects remember what they ate (dietary recall analysis) is not as accurate as a tissue biopsy, which reports exactly what was really eaten.

Foods cooked in oil or coated with oils soak up more oil than you think. A low-calorie "healthy" food easily becomes fattening. Most Americans eat negligible amounts of salad vegetables, but when they do eat a small salad, they consume about three leaves of iceberg let- tuce in a small bowl and then proceed to pour three or four table- spoons of oily dressing on top. Since oil is about 120 calories per tablespoon, they consume some 400 (empty) calories from dressing and about 18 from lettuce. They might as well forget the lettuce and just drink the dressing straight from the bottle.


There is considerable evidence to suggest that consuming mono- unsaturated fats such as olive oil is less destructive to your health than the dangerous saturated and trans fats. But a lower-fat diet could be more dangerous than one with a higher level of fat if the lower-fat diet had more saturated and trans fats.

##### The Popularity of the Mediterranean Diet

__Research has shown that weight loss is about the same from any type of food eaten when caloric intake is equally low.
Their main message is threefold: first, eat mostly phytochemical-rich plant foods to maximize health and disease prevention; second, caloric re- striction and exercise must be maintained for positive results; and third, healthy fats, especially olive oil, should not be restricted, because a diet without these fats is both unhealthy and unpalatable.__

When vegetables are cooked, or eaten with fat, some nutrients are more efficiently absorbed and other heat-sensitive nutrients are lost or rendered less absorbable. Many studies show that raw fruits and vegetables offer the highest blood levels of cancer-protective nutrients and the most protection against cancer of any other foods, including cooked vegetation. Any advice not recognizing that raw vegetables and fresh fruits are the two most powerful anti-cancer categories of foods is off the mark.

__My advice is extremely different. I recognize that raw, uncooked vegetables and fruits offer the most powerful protection against dis- ease and I encourage my patients to eat huge salads and at least four fresh fruits per day. Diets with little raw foods are not ideal. As the amount of raw fruits and vegetables are increased in a person's diet,weight loss and blood pressure are lowered effortlessly.__

Additionally, raw foods contain enzymes, some of which can survive the digestive process in the stomach and pass into the small intestines. These heat-sensitive elements may offer significant nutri- tional advantages to protect against disease, according to investiga- tors from the Department of Biochemistry at Wright State University School of Medicine.

__These researchers concluded that "most foods undergo a decrease in nutritive value in addition to the well-known loss of vitamins when cooked and/or processed." Most vitamins are heat-sensitive, for example 20-60 percent of vitamin C is lost, depending on the cooking method. Thirty to forty percent of minerals are lost in cooking vegetables as well. Consuming a significant quantity of raw foods is essential for superior health.__

For the best results, your diet should contain a huge amount of raw foods, a large amount of the less calorically dense cooked vege- tation, and a lesser amount of the more calorically rich cooked starchy vegetables and grains. Cooking your food in oil will make your diet less effective and you will not lose weight as easily. You may not even lose any weight at all.

The bottom line about healthy fats is that raw nuts and seeds, av- ocados, and unsalted olives (if you can find them) contain healthy fats. However, you should consume a limited amount of these foods, especially if you wish to lose weight. Also remember that oil, includ- ing olive oil, does not contain the nutrients and phytonutrients that were in the original olive. The oil has little nutrients (except a little vitamin E) and a negligible amount of phytochemical compounds. If you eat the quantities of oil permitted on the typical Mediterranean diet, where all the vegetables are cooked in oil, you will have diffi- culty taking off the weight you need to lose.
