* Recommand book : Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss -- by Joel Fuhrman 

# Introduction

Scientific studies show a clear and strong relationship between cancers of the digestive tract, bladder, and prostate with low fruit consumption. 


These results sound fantastic, and they are — but they are also true and predictable on my program. The key to this extraordinary diet is a simple formula: 

```
H = N/C.
Health = Nutrients/Calories
```

__Your health is predicted by your nutrient intake divided by your intake of calories.__

H = N/C is a concept I call the __nutrient-density__ of your diet. Food supplies us with both nutrients and calories (energy). __All calories come from only three elements: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.__ ___Nutrients are derived from noncaloric food factors — including vitamins, minerals, fibers, and phytochemicals. These noncaloric nutrients are vitally important for health.__ Your key to permanent weight loss is to eat predominantly those foods that have a high proportion of nutrients (noncaloric food factors) to calories (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins). In physics a key formula is Einstein's E = mc . In nutrition the key formula is H = N/C.

Every food can be evaluated using this formula. Once you begin to learn which foods make the grade — by having a high proportion of nutrients to calories — you are on your way to lifelong weight control and improved health.

Eating large quantities of high-nutrient foods is the secret to op- timal health and permanent weight control. In fact, eating much larger portions of food is one of the beauties of the Eat to Live diet. You eat more, which effectively blunts your appetite, and you lose weight — permanently.

The Eat to Live diet does not require any deprivation. In fact, you do not have to give up any foods completely. However, as you con- sume larger and larger portions of health-supporting, high-nutrient foods, your appetite for low-nutrient foods decreases and you grad- ually lose your addiction to them. You will be able to make a com- plete commitment to this diet for the rest of your life.

# Digging Our Graves with Forks and Knives THE EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN DIET, PART I

People whose parents are obese have a tenfold increased risk of being obese. On the other hand, obese families tend to have obese pets, which is obviously not genetic. So it is the combination of food choices, inactivity, and genetics that determines obesity.

Obesity is not just a cosmetic issue — extra weight leads to an earlier death, as many studies confirm. Overweight individuals are more likely to die from all causes, including heart disease and cancer. Two-thirds of those with weight problems also have hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or another obesity-related condition.

```
Health Complications of Obesity
Increased overall premature mortality • Adult onset diabetes
* Hypertension
* Degenerative arthritis
* Coronary artery disease 
* Cancer
* Lipid disorders
* Obstructive sleep apnea 
* Gallstones
* Fatty infiltration of liver
* Restrictive lung disease
* Gastrointestinal diseases
```

It is for this simple yet much overlooked reason: for the vast majority of people, being overweight is not caused by how much they eat but by what they eat. The idea that people get heavy because they consume a high volume of food is a myth. Eating large amounts of the right food is your key to success and is what makes this plan workable for the rest of your life. What makes many people over- weight is not that they eat so much more but that they get a higher percentage of their calories from fat and refined carbohydrates, or mostly low-nutrient foods. This low-nutrient diet establishes a favor- able cellular environment for disease to flourish.

In studies on identical twins with the tendency to be overweight, scientists found that physical activity is the strongest environmental determinant of total body and central abdominal fat mass. Even those with a strong family history of obesity effectively lose weight with increased physical activity and appropriate dietary modifications.

Most of the time, the reason people are overweight is too little physical activity, in conjunction with a high-calorie. low-nutrient diet. Eating a diet with plenty of low-fiber, calorie-dense food, such as oil and refined carbohydrates, is the main culprit.

Dr. I-Min Lee, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said her twenty-seven-year study of 19,297 men found there was no such thing as being too thin. Among men who never smoked, the lowest mortality occurred in the lightest fifth.Those who were in the thinnest 20 percent in the early 1960s were two and a half times less likely to have died of cardiovascular disease by 1988 than those in the heaviest fifth. Lee stated, "We observed a di- rect relationship between body weight and mortality. By that I mean that the thinnest fifth of men experienced the lowest mortality, and mortality increased progressively with heavier and heavier weight."

##### The Longer Your Waistline, the Shorter Your Lifeline 

As a good rule of thumb: for optimal health and longevity, a man should not have more than one-half inch of skin that he can pinch near his umbilicus (belly button) and a woman should not have more than one inch. Almost any fat on the body over this minimum is a health risk. If you have gained even as little as ten pounds since the age of eighteen or twenty, then you could be at significant in- creased risk for health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The truth is that most people who think they are at the right weight still have too much fat on their body.

##### The Only Way to Significantly Increase Life Span


The evidence for increasing one's life span through dietary restriction is enormous and irrefutable. Reduced caloric intake is the only ex- perimental technique to consistently extend maximum life span. This has been shown in all species tested, from insects and fish to rats and cats. 

High-nutrient, low-calorie eating results in dramatic increases in life span as well as prevention of chronic illnesses. From rodents to primates we see:

```
* Resistance to experimentally induced cancers
* Protection from spontaneous and genetically predisposed
* A delay in the onset of late-life diseases
* Nonappearance of atherosclerosis and diabetes
* Lower cholesterol and triglycerides and increased HDL 
* Improved insulin sensitivity
* Enhancement of the energy-conservation mechanism, includ- ing reduced body temperature
* Reduction in oxidative stress
* Reduction in parameters of cellular aging, including cellular congestion
* Enhancement of cellular repair mechanisms, including DNA repair enzymes
* Reduction in inflammatory response and immune cell proliferation
* Improved defenses against environmental stresses
* Suppression of the genetic alterations associated with aging 
* Protection of genes associated with removal of oxygen radicals 
* Inhibited production of metabolites that are potent cross-linking agents
* Slowed metabolic rate
```

The link between thinness and longevity, and obesity and a shorter life span, is concrete. Another important consideration in other animal studies is that fat restriction has an additional effect on lengthening life span. Apparently, higher-fat intake promotes hormone production, speeds up reproductive readiness and other indicators of aging, and promotes the growth of certain tumors.

##### To Avoid Overeating on High-Calorie Foods, Fill Up on Nutrient-Rich Ones

An important corollary to the principle of limiting high-calorie food is that the only way for a human being to safely achieve the benefits of caloric restriction while ensuring that the diet is nutritionally ade- quate is to avoid as much as possible those foods that are nutrient poor.


Indeed, this is the crucial consideration in deciding what to eat. __We need to eat foods with adequate nutrients so we won't need to consume excess "empty" calories to reach our nutritional requirements. Eating foods that are rich in nutrients and fiber, and low in calories, "fills us up," so to speak, thus preventing us from overeating.__

To grasp why this works, let us look at how the brain controls our dietary drive. A complicated system of chemoreceptors in the nerves lining the digestive tract carefully monitor the calorie and nutrient density of every mouthful and send such information to the hypo- thalamus in the brain, which controls dietary drive.

There are also stretch receptors in the stomach to signal satiety by detecting the *volume* of food eaten, not the *weight* of the food. If you are not filled up with nutrients and fiber, the brain will send out signals telling you to eat more food, or overeat.

In fact, if you consume sufficient nutrients and fiber, you will become *biochemically* filled (__nutrients__) and *mechanically* filled (__fiber__), and your desire to consume calories will be blunted or turned down. One key factor that determines whether you will be overweight is your failure to consume sufficient fiber and nutrients. This has been illustrated in scientific studies.

Liquid calories, without the fiber present in the whole food, have little effect at blunting our caloric drive. Studies show that fruit juice and other sweet beverages lead to obesity in children as well.

If you are serious about losing weight, don't drink your fruit, eat it. Too much fiber and too many nutrients are removed during juicing, and many of the remaining nutrients are lost through processing, heat, and storage time. If you are not overweight, drinking fresh-prepared juice is acceptable as long as it does not serve as a substitute for eating those fresh fruits and vegetables. There is no substitute for natural whole foods.

### What if I Have a Slow Metabolic Rate?

Your body weight may be affected slightly by genetics, but that effect is not strong. __Furthermore, I am convinced that inheriting a slow metabolic rate with a tendency to gain weight is not a flaw or defect but rather a genetic gift that can be taken advantage of. How is this possible? A slower metabolism is associated with longer life span in all species of animals.__ 

As you can see, it is not always bad to have a slow metabolic rate. It can be good. Sure, it is bad in today's environment of relentless eating and when consuming a high-calorie, low-nutrient diet. Sure, it will increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease and cancer, given today's food-consumption patterns. __However, if correct food choices are made to maintain a normal weight, the individual with a slower metabolism may age more slowly.__

Our body is like a machine. If we constantly run the machinery at high speed, it will wear out faster. Since animals with slower metabolic rates live longer, eating more calories, which drives up our metabolic rate, will cause us only to age faster. Contrary to what you may have heard and read in the past, our goal should be the opposite: to eat less, only as much as we need to maintain a slim and muscular weight, and no more, so as to keep our metabolic rate relatively slow.


So stop worrying about your slower metabolic rate. A slower metabolic rate from dieting is not the primary cause of your weight problem. Keep these three important points in mind:
1. Resting metabolic rates do decline slightly during periods of lower caloric intake, but not enough to significantly inhibit weight loss.
2. Resting metabolic rates return to normal soon after caloric in- take is no longer restricted. The lowered metabolic rate does not stay low permanently and make future dieting more difficult.
3. A sudden lowering of the metabolic rate from dieting does not explain the weight gain/loss cycles experienced by many over-weight people. These fluctuations in weight are primarily from going on and getting off diets. It is especially difficult to stay with a reduced-calorie diet when it never truly satisfies the individual's biochemical need for nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals.

__Those with a genetic tendency to overweight may actually have the genetic potential to outlive the rest of us.__ The key to their successful longevity lies in their choosing a nutrient-rich, fiber-rich, lower- calorie diet, as well as getting adequate physical activity. By adjusting the nutrient-per-calorie density of your diet to your metabolic rate, you can use your slow metabolism to your advantage. When you can maintain a normal weight in spite of a slow metabolism, you will be able to achieve significant longevity.


#  Overfed, Yet Malnourished THE EFFECTS OF THE AMERICAN DIET, PART II


##### The Pros and Cons of Our "Natural Sweet Tooth"

__Fruit is an essential part of our diets. It is an indispensable requirement for us to maintain a high level of health. Fruit consumption has been shown in numerous studies to offer our strongest protection against certain cancers, especially oral and esophageal, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Thankfully, our natural sweet tooth directs us to those foods ideally "designed" for our primate her- itage — fruit. Fresh fruit offers us powerful health-giving benefits.__


Researchers have discovered substances in fruit that have unique effects on preventing aging and deterioration of the brain. Some fruits, especially blueberries, are rich in anthocyanins and other compounds having anti-aging effects. Studies continue to provide evidence that more than any other food, fruit consumption is associated with lowered mortality from all cancers combined. Eating fruit is vital to your health, well-being, and long life. 


#####  Nutritional Lightweights: Pasta and White Bread

Unlike the fruits found in nature — which have a full ensemble of nutrients — processed carbohydrates (such as bread, pasta, and cake) are deficient in fiber, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, all of which have been lost in processing.

Medical investigations clearly show the dangers of consuming the quantity of processed foods that we do. And because these re- fined grains lack the fiber and nutrient density to turn down our appetite, they also cause obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and significantly increased cancer risk.

Summarizing fifteen epidemiological studies, researchers concluded that diets containing refined grains and refined sweets were consis- tently linked to stomach and colon cancer, and at least twelve breast cancer studies connect low-fiber diets with increased risks.

Eating diet that contains a significant quantity of sugar and refined flour does not just cause weight gain, it also leads to an earlier death.

If you want to lose weight, the most important foods to avoid arc processed foods: condiments, candy, snacks, and baked goods; fat- free has nothing to do with it. Almost all weight-loss authorities agree on this — you must cut out the refined carbohydrates, includ- ing bagels, pasta, and bread. As far as the human body is concerned, low-fiber carbohydrates such as pasta are almost as damaging as white sugar. Pasta is not health food — it is hurt food.

##### Soil Depletion of Nutrients Is Not the Problem- Our Food Choices Are

It is not merely dental cavities that should concern us about sugar. If we allow ourselves and our children to utilize sugar, white- flour products, and oil to supply the majority of calories, as most American families do, we shall be condemning ourselves to a lifetime of sickness, medical problems, and a premature death.

__Refined sugars include table sugar (sucrose), milk sugar (lactose), honey, brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, molasses, corn sweeteners, and fruit juice concentrates. Even the bottled and boxed fruit juices that many children drink are a poor food; with no significant nutrient density, they lead to obesity and disease. Processed apple juice, which is not far from sugar water in its nutrient score, accounts for almost 50 percent of all fruit servings consumed by preschoolers.
For example, apple juice contains none of the vitamin C originally present in the whole apple. Oranges make the most nutritious juice, but even orange juice can't compare with the original orange. In citrus fruits, most of the anti-cancer compounds are present in the membranes and pulp, which are removed in processing juice. Those cardboard containers of orange juice contain less than 10 percent of the vitamin C present in an orange and even less of the fiber and phytochemicals. Juice is not fruit, and prepackaged juices do not con- tain even one-tenth of the nutrients present in fresh fruit.__

##### Processed carbohydrates, lacking in fiber, fail to slow sugar absorption, causing wide swings in glucose levels.

Empty calories are empty calories. Cookies, jams, and other pro- cessed foods (even those from the health-food store) sweetened with "fruit juice" sound healthier but are just as bad as white-sugar prod- ucts. When fruit juice is concentrated and used as a sweetener, the healthy nutritional components are stripped away — what's left is plain sugar. To your body, there is not much difference between refined sugar, fruit juice sweeteners, honey, fruit juice concentrate, or any other concentrated sweetener. Our sweet tooth has been put there by nature to have us enjoy and consume real fruit, not some imitation. Fresh-squeezed orange juice and other fresh fruit and veg- etable juices are relatively healthy foods that contain the majority of the original vitamins and minerals. But the sweet fruit juices and even carrot juice should still be used only moderately, as they still contain a high concentration of sugar calories and no fiber. Still not an ideal food for those desiring to lose weight. I often use these juices as part of salad dressings and other dishes rather than alone as a drink. __Fresh fruits and even dried fruits do contain an assortment of protective nutrients and phytochemicals, so stick with the real thing.__

##### Enrichment with Nutrients Is a House Made of Straw

White or "enriched" rice is just as bad as white bread and pasta. It is nutritionally bankrupt.Refining the rice removes the same im- portant factors: fiber, minerals, phytochemicals, and vitamin E. So, when you eat grains, eat whole grains.Refining foods removes so much nutrition that our government requires that a few synthetic vitamins and minerals be added back.As we change food through processing and refining, we rob the food of certain health-supporting substances and often create un- healthy compounds, thus making it a more unfit food for human consumption. __As a general rule of thumb: the closer we eat foods to their natural state, the healthier the food.__

##### Not All Whole-Wheat Products Are Equal

__Eating fragmented and unbalanced foods causes many problems, espe- cially for those trying to lose weight.__ 
Whole-grain hot cereals are less processed than cold cereals and come up with better nutritional scores. They can be soaked in water overnight so you do not have to cook them in the morning. Some hot whole-grain cereals that I recommend are oatmeal (not instant), Roman Meal, Steel Cut Oats, Wheatena, Ralston High Fiber, and Quaker Multigrain.

##### Fat and Refined Carbohydrates: Married to Your Waist

The body converts food fat into body fat quickly and easily: 100 calo- ries of ingested fat can be converted to 97 calories of body fat by burning a measly 3 calories. Fat is an appetite stimulant: the more you eat, the more you want. If a food could be scientifically engineered to create an obese society, it would have fat, such as butter, mixed with sugar and flour.

The combination of fat and refined carbohydrates has an ex- tremely powerful effect on driving the signals that promote fat accu- mulation on the body. Refined foods cause a swift and excessive rise in blood sugar, which in turn triggers insulin surges to drive the sugar out of the blood and into our cells. Unfortunately, insulin also promotes the storage of fat on the body and encourages your fat cells to swell.

As more fat is packed away on the body, it interferes with insulin uptake into our muscle tissues. Our pancreas then senses that the glucose level in the bloodstream is still too high and pumps out even more insulin. A little extra fat around our midsection results in so much interference with insulin's effectiveness that two to five times as much insulin may be secreted in an overweight person than in a thin person.

The higher level of insulin in turn promotes more efficient con- version of our caloric intake into body fat, and this vicious cycle con- tinues. People get heavier and heavier as time goes on.

Eating refined carbohydrates — as opposed to complex carbohy- drates in their natural state — causes the body's "set point" for body weight to increase. Your "set point" is the weight the body tries to maintain through the brain's control of hormonal messengers. When you eat refined fats (oils) or refined carbohydrates such as white flour and sugar, the fat-storing hormones are produced in excess, raising the set point. To further compound the problem, because so much of the vitamin and mineral content of these foods has been lost during processing, you naturally crave more food to make up for the missing nutrients.

##### Our Oil-Rich Country, or FromYour Lips Right to Your Hips

__Fat, such as olive oil, can be stored on your body within minutes, without costing the body any caloric price; it is just packed away (un- changed) on your hips and waist. If we biopsied your waist fat and looked at it under an electron microscope, we could actually see where the fat came from. It is stored there as pig fat, dairy fat, and olive oil fat —just as it was in the original food. It goes from your lips right to your hips. Actually, more fat from your last meal is deposited around your waist than on your hips, for both men and women.__ Analyzing these body-fat deposits is an accurate way for research scientists to discern food intake over time. Having research subjects remember what they ate (dietary recall analysis) is not as accurate as a tissue biopsy, which reports exactly what was really eaten.

Foods cooked in oil or coated with oils soak up more oil than you think. A low-calorie "healthy" food easily becomes fattening. Most Americans eat negligible amounts of salad vegetables, but when they do eat a small salad, they consume about three leaves of iceberg let- tuce in a small bowl and then proceed to pour three or four table- spoons of oily dressing on top. Since oil is about 120 calories per tablespoon, they consume some 400 (empty) calories from dressing and about 18 from lettuce. They might as well forget the lettuce and just drink the dressing straight from the bottle.


There is considerable evidence to suggest that consuming mono- unsaturated fats such as olive oil is less destructive to your health than the dangerous saturated and trans fats. But a lower-fat diet could be more dangerous than one with a higher level of fat if the lower-fat diet had more saturated and trans fats.

##### The Popularity of the Mediterranean Diet

__Research has shown that weight loss is about the same from any type of food eaten when caloric intake is equally low.
Their main message is threefold: first, eat mostly phytochemical-rich plant foods to maximize health and disease prevention; second, caloric re- striction and exercise must be maintained for positive results; and third, healthy fats, especially olive oil, should not be restricted, because a diet without these fats is both unhealthy and unpalatable.__

When vegetables are cooked, or eaten with fat, some nutrients are more efficiently absorbed and other heat-sensitive nutrients are lost or rendered less absorbable. Many studies show that raw fruits and vegetables offer the highest blood levels of cancer-protective nutrients and the most protection against cancer of any other foods, including cooked vegetation. Any advice not recognizing that raw vegetables and fresh fruits are the two most powerful anti-cancer categories of foods is off the mark.

__My advice is extremely different. I recognize that raw, uncooked vegetables and fruits offer the most powerful protection against disease and I encourage my patients to eat huge salads and at least four fresh fruits per day. Diets with little raw foods are not ideal. As the amount of raw fruits and vegetables are increased in a person's diet,weight loss and blood pressure are lowered effortlessly.__

Additionally, raw foods contain enzymes, some of which can survive the digestive process in the stomach and pass into the small intestines. These heat-sensitive elements may offer significant nutri- tional advantages to protect against disease, according to investiga- tors from the Department of Biochemistry at Wright State University School of Medicine.

__These researchers concluded that "most foods undergo a decrease in nutritive value in addition to the well-known loss of vitamins when cooked and/or processed." Most vitamins are heat-sensitive, for example 20-60 percent of vitamin C is lost, depending on the cooking method. Thirty to forty percent of minerals are lost in cooking vegetables as well. Consuming a significant quantity of raw foods is essential for superior health.__

For the best results, your diet should contain a huge amount of raw foods, a large amount of the less calorically dense cooked vege- tation, and a lesser amount of the more calorically rich cooked starchy vegetables and grains. Cooking your food in oil will make your diet less effective and you will not lose weight as easily. You may not even lose any weight at all.

The bottom line about healthy fats is that raw nuts and seeds, av- ocados, and unsalted olives (if you can find them) contain healthy fats. However, you should consume a limited amount of these foods, especially if you wish to lose weight. Also remember that oil, includ- ing olive oil, does not contain the nutrients and phytonutrients that were in the original olive. The oil has little nutrients (except a little vitamin E) and a negligible amount of phytochemical compounds. If you eat the quantities of oil permitted on the typical Mediterranean diet, where all the vegetables are cooked in oil, you will have diffi- culty taking off the weight you need to lose.

##### The "Magic" of Fiber - A Critical Nutrient

Fiber is a vital nutrient, essential to human health. __When you eat mostly natural plant foods, such as fruits, vegeta- bles, and beans, you get large amounts of various types of fiber. These foods are rich in complex carbohydrates and both insoluble and water-soluble fibers. The fibers slow down glucose absorption and control the rate of digestion. Plant fibers have complex physiological effects in the digestive tract that offer a variety of benefits,such as lowering cholesterol.__

Because of fiber, and because precious food components haven't been lost through processing, natural plant foods fill you up and do not cause abnormal physiological cravings or hormonal imbalances.

__There's a lesson to be learned here: Don't get your health advice from the media.__

As in a trial, the evidence has become overwhelming and irrefutable — high-fiber foods offer significant protection against both cancer (including colon cancer) and heart disease.

The reality is that healthy, nutritious foods are also very rich in fiber and that those foods associated with disease risk are generally fiber-deficient. Meat and dairy products do not contain any fiber, and foods made from refined grains (such as white bread, white rice, and pasta) have had their fiber removed. Clearly, we must substantially reduce our consumption of these fiber-deficient foods if we expect to lose weight and live a long, healthy life.

# 3 Phytochemicals: Nature's "Magic" Pills

__Potatoes are one of the least nutritious vegetables.__ 

The diseases of poverty are mostly infectious diseases and are found in areas of the world with compromised nutrition. Heart attacks and the most common cancers (breast, colon, prostate) are found in rich societies where nutritional extravagance is the rule. Nowhere in the world today can we find a society that combines economic wealth with a high intake and variety of unrefined plant foods.

##### Nutritional Powerhouses: Plant Foods

Natural plant foods, though usually carbohydrate-rich, also contain protein and fats. On average, 25 percent of the calories in vegetables are from protein. Romaine lettuce, for example, is rich in both pro- tein and essential fatty acids, giving us those healthy fats our bodies require.

There is no longer any question about the importance of fruits and vegetables in our diet. The greater the quantity and assortment of fruits and vegetables consumed, the lower the incidence of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. There is still some controversy about which foods cause which cancers and whether certain types of fat are the culprits with certain cancers, but there's one thing we know for sure: raw vegetables and fresh fruits have powerful anti-cancer agents.

Studies have repeatedly shown the correlation between consumption of these foods and a lower incidence of various cancers, including those of the breast, colon, rectum, lung, stomach, prostate, and pancreas. This means that your risk of cancer decreases with an increased intake of fruits and vegetables, and the earlier in life you start eating large amounts of these foods, the more protection you get.

__Humans are genetically adapted to expect a high intake of natural and unprocessed plant-derived substances. Cancer is a disease of maladaptation. It results primarily from a body's lacking critical substances found in different types of vegetation, many of which are still undiscovered, that are metabolically necessary for normal protective function.__ Natural foods unadulterated by man are highly complex — so complex that the exact structure and the majority of compounds they contain are not precisely known. A tomato, for example, contains more than ten thousand different phytochemicals.

It may never be possible to extract the precise symphony of nutri- ents found in vegetation and place it in a pill. Isolated nutrients ex- tracted from food may never offer the same level of disease-protective effects of whole natural foods, as nature "designed" them. Fruits and vegetables contain a variety of nutrients, which work in subtle syn- ergies, and many of these nutrients cannot be isolated or extracted. Phytochemicals from a variety of plant foods work together to become much more potent at detoxifying carcinogens and protecting against cancer than when taken individually as isolated compounds.

##### The Phytochemical Revolution

We are on the verge of a revolution. Substances newly discovered in broccoli and cabbage sprouts sweep toxins out of cells. Substances found in nuts and beans prevent damage to our cells' DNA. Other compounds in beets, peppers, and tomatoes fight cancerous changes in cells. Oranges and apples protect our blood vessels from damage that could lead to heart disease. Nature's chemoprotective army is alert and ready to remove our enemies and shield us from harm.

Hardly a day goes by when some new study doesn't proclaim the health-giving properties of fruits, vegetables, and beans. Unprocessed plant foods contain thousands of compounds, most of which have not yet been discovered, that are essential for maintaining health and maximizing genetic potential. Welcome to the phytochemical revolution.

Phytochemicals, or plant-derived chemicals, occur naturally in plants (phylo means "plant"). These nutrients, which scientists are just starting to discover and name, have tremendously beneficial ef- fects on human physiology. The effects of our not consuming suffi- cient amounts of them are even more astounding — premature death from cancer and atherosclerosis.

__Eating a wide variety of raw and conservatively cooked plant foods (such as steamed vegetables) is the only way we can ensure that we get a sufficient amount of these essential health-supporting elements. Taking vitamin and mineral supplements or adding some vitamins to processed foods will not prevent the diseases associated with eating a diet containing a low percentage of calories from whole natural foods.__

##### You Cannot Buy Your Health in a Bottle - You Must Earn It!


When your nutrient intake is out of balance, health problems may result. For example, beta-carotene has been touted as a powerful an- tioxidant and anti-cancer vitamin. However, in recent years we have discovered that beta-carotene is only one of about five hundred carotenoids. Scientists are finding that taking beta-carotene supple- ments is not without risk, and supplements are certainly a poor sub- stitute for the real tiling — the assortment of various carotenoid compounds found in plants.

The reason researchers believed beta-carotene had such a pow- erful anti-cancer effect was that populations with high levels of beta- carotene in their bloodstream had exceedingly low rates of cancer. More recently we found out that these people were protected against cancer because of hundreds of carotenoids and phytochemicals in the fruits and vegetables they were consuming. It wasn't that beta-carotene was responsible for the low incidence of cancer; it merely served as a flag for those populations with a high fruit and vegetable intake. Un- fortunately, many scientists confused the flag for the ship.

##### Cancer Is Much More Preventable than Treatable


The process of carcinogenesis entails an accumulation of mutations or damage to our DNA (the cellular blueprint) over the course of twenty to forty years. __You must start protecting yourself today, not after you find out you have cancer. Cancer is much more preventable than treatable.__ Instead, many try to dig a well after their house is on fire. 

The process of cellular disintegration is extremely prolonged, and we know that many pre-neoplastic lesions (abnormal, but not yet cancer) disappear spontaneously. __Studies on both humans and animals have shown that plant-derived nutrients are able to prevent the occurrence of, and even reverse, DNA damage that may later result in cancer. Fortunately, we have the potential to suppress the progression of cancer in its early stages by how we choose to eat. The ability to remove and fix these partially damaged cells is proportional to their exposure to phytochemicals.__


When we consume a sufficient variety and quantity of phyto- chemical substances to maximally arm our immune defenses against cancer, we afford ourselves the ability to repair DNA damage, detox- ify cancer-causing agents, and resist disease in general. These same substances also activate other immune-enhancing mechanisms that improve our defenses against viruses and bacteria, making our body disease-resistant in general.

##### Green Plant Foods vs. Animal Foods

__Steak only has 5.4 grams of protein per 100 calories and broccoli has 11.2 grams, almost twice as much.__

Keep in mind that most of the calories in meat come from fat; green vegetables are mostly protein (all calories must come from fat, carbohydrate, or protein).


##### Popeye Was Right - Greens Pack a Powerful Punch

The biggest animals — elephants, gorillas, rhinoceroses, hippopota- muses, and giraffes — all eat predominantly green vegetation. How did they get the protein to get so big? Obviously, greens pack a pow- erful protein punch. In fact, all protein on the planet was formed from the effect of sunlight on green plants. The cow didn't eat an- other cow to form the protein in its muscles, which we call steak. The protein wasn't formed out of thin air — the cow ate grass. Not that protein is such a big deal or some special nutrient to be held in high esteem. I am making this point because most people think animal products are necessary for a diet to include adequate protein. I am merely illustrating how easy it is to consume more than enough pro- tein while at the same time avoiding risky, cancer-promoting sub- stances such as saturated fat. Consuming more plant protein is also the key to achieving safe and successful weight loss.

When you consider the fiber, phytochemicals, and other essen- tial nutrients, green vegetables win the award for being the most nutrient-dense of all foods. We will give greens a score of 100 and judge all other foods against this criterion.

##### The Secret of Extreme Longevity

Interestingly, there is one food that scientific research has shown has a strong positive association with increased longevity in humans. So which food do you think that is?

__The answer is raw, leafy greens, normally referred to as salad. Leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, kale, collards, Swiss chard, and spinach are the most nutrient-dense of all foods.__

Most vegetables contain more nutrients per calorie than any other food and are rich in all necessary amino acids. For example, ro- maine lettuce, which gets 18 percent of its calories from fat and al- most 50 percent of its calories from protein, is a rich powerhouse with hundreds of cancer-fighting phytonutrients that protect us from a variety of threatening illnesses. Being healthy and owning a disease- resistant body is not luck; it is earned.

__In a review of 206 human-population studies, raw vegetable consumption showed the strongest protective effect against cancer of any beneficial food.__

I tell my patients to put a big sign on their refrigerator that says THE SALAD IS THE MAIN DISH.

The word salad here means any vegetable eaten raw or uncooked, e.g., a bowl of cold pasta in olive oil with a token vegetable is not a salad. __I encourage my patients to eat two huge salads a day, with the goal of consuming an entire head of romaine or other green lettuce daily.__

##### Green Salad Is Less than 100 Calories per Pound

Did you notice that 100 calories of broccoli is about ten ounces of food, and 100 calories of ground sirloin is less than one ounce of food? With green vegetables you can get filled up, even stuffed, yet you will not be consuming excess calories. __Animal products, on the other hand, are calorie-dense and relatively low in nutrients, especially the crucial anti-cancer nutrients.__

##### Weighing Food and Trying to Eat Smaller Portions Is Futile

We must consume a certain level of calories daily to feel satisfied. So now I ask you to completely rethink what you consider a typical portion size. To achieve superior health and a permanently thin physique, you should eat large portions of green foods. When con- sidering any green plant food, remember to make the portion size huge by conventional standards. Eating large portions of these super- healthy foods is the key to your success.

# The Dark Side of Animal Protein

### The China Project


Fortunately, evidence from a massive series of scientific investigations has shed some light on the confusion. The China-Cornell-Oxford Project (also known as the China Project) is the most comprehensive study on the connection between diet and disease in medical history.

__Researchers found that as the amount of animal foods increased in the diet, even in relatively small increments, so did the emergence of the cancers that are common in the West. Most cancers occurred in direct proportion to the quantity of animal foods consumed.__

__In other words, as animal food consumption approached zero, cancer rates fell. Areas of the country with an extremely low consumption of animal food were virtually free of heart attacks and cancer.__ An analysis of the mortality data from 65 counties and 130 villages showed a significant association with animal protein intake (even at relatively low levels) and heart attacks, with a strong protective effect from the consumption of green vegetables.

The China Project showed a strong correlation between cancer and the amount of animal protein, not just animal fat, consumed. Consumption of lean meats and poultry still showed a strong correla- tion with higher cancer incidence. These findings indicate that even low-fat animal foods such as skinless white-meat chicken are impli- cated in certain cancers.

##### Heart Health - It's Not Just Fat and Cholesterol

Scientific studies provide evidence that animal protein's effect on blood cholesterol may be significant. This is one of the reasons those switching to a low-fat diet do not experience the cholesterol lower- ing they expect unless they also remove the low-fat animal products as well. Surprising to most people is that yes, even low-fat dairy and skinless white-meat chicken raise cholesterol.

__Red meat is not the only problem. The consumption of chicken and fish is also linked to colon cancer.__

Chicken has about the same amount of cholesterol as beef, and the production of those potent cancer-causing compounds called het- erocyclic amines (HCAs) are even more concentrated in grilled chicken than in beef." Another recent study from New Zealand that investi- gated heterocyclic amines in meat, fish, and chicken found the greatest contributor of HCAs to cancer risk was chicken. 

Likewise, studies indicate that chicken is almost as dangerous as red meat for the heart. Regarding cholesterol, there is no advantage to eating lean white instead of lean red meat. __The best bet for overall health is to significantly limit or eliminate all types of meat—red and white.__ Dr. Campbell explains further his view that animal protein (in addition to animal fats) are implicated in disease causation: " I really believe that dietary protein—both the kind and the amount—is more significant, as far as cholesterol levels are concerned, than is saturated fat. Certainly it is more significant than dietary cholesterol. We do know that animal protein has a quick and major impact on enzymes involved in the metabolism of cholesterol. Whether it is the immune system, various enzyme systems, the uptake of carcinogens into the cells, or hormonal activities, animal protein generally only causes mischief."

__Cholesterol levels can be decreased by reducing both saturated fat and animal protein while eating more plant protein.__

The China Project confirmed that there were virtually no heart attacks in populations that consume a life-long vegetarian diet and almost no heart attacks in populations consuming a diet that is rich in natural plant foods and receives less than 10 percent of its calories from animal foods.

##### Understanding the Conflicting and Confusing Cancer Studies

After studying multiple diseases, not just one type of cancer, the researchers involved in the China Project concluded: "There appears to be no threshold of plant-food enrichment or minimization of ani- mal product intake beyond which further disease prevention does not occur. These findings suggest that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cho- lesterol concentration, which are associated, in turn, with significant increases in chronic degenerative disease mortality rates." In other words, populations with very low cholesterol levels have not only low heart-disease rates but low cancer rates as well.

##### Cancer Is a Fruit- and Vegetable-Deficiency Disease


Not surprisingly, fruits and vegetables are the two foods with the best correlation with longevity in humans. Not whole-wheat bread, not bran, not even a vegetarian diet shows as powerful a correlation as a high level of fresh fruit and raw green salad consumption. The National Cancer Institute recently reported on 337 different studies that all showed the same basic information:
1. Vegetables and fruits protect against all types of cancers if consumed in large enough quantities. Hundreds of scientific stud- ies document this. The most prevalent cancers in our country are mostly plant-food-deficiency diseases.
2. Raw vegetables have the most powerful anti-cancer properties of all foods.    
3. Studies on the cancer-reducing effects of vitamin pills contain- ing various nutrients (such as folate, vitamin C and E) get mixed reviews; sometimes they show a slight benefit, but most show no benefit. Occasionally studies show that taking iso- lated nutrients is harmful, as was discussed earlier regarding beta-carotene.  
4. Beans, in general, not just soy, have additional anti-cancer benefits against reproductive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer.  

##### A Vegetarian Diet Is No Guarantee of Good Health

People who omit meat, fowl, and dairy but fill up on bread, pasta, pretzels, bagels, rice cakes, and crackers may be on a low-fat diet, but because their diet is also low in vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, important essential fatty acids, and fiber, it is conspicuously inade- quate and should not be expected to protect against cancer. Addi- tionally, because these refined grains are low in fiber, they do not make you feel full until after you have taken in too many calories from them. In other words, both their nutrient-to-calorie and nutrient- to-fiber ratios are extremely low.

Let me repeat this again to be clear: __Following a strict vegetarian diet is not as important as eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.__ A vegetarian whose diet is mainly refined grains, cold breakfast cere- als, processed health-food-store products, vegetarian fast foods, white rice, and pasta will be worse off than a person who eats a little chicken or eggs, for example, but consumes a large amount of fruits, vegeta- bles, and beans.

Remember, long-term vegans (stria vegetarians who consume no dairy or other foods of animal origin) almost never get heart at- tacks. If you have heart disease or a strong family history of heart dis- ease, you should consider avoiding all animal-based products.

__The research shows that those who avoid meat and dairy have lower rates of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. The data is conclusive: vegetarians live longer in America, probably a lot longer.__

##### How Much Longer Do Vegetarians Live?

Whether you eat a vegetarian diet or include a small amount of animal foods, for optimal health you must receive the majority of your calories from unrefined plant food. It is the large quantity of unrefined plant food that grants the greatest protection against developing serious disease.

##### Understanding the Factors Involved in the Development of Cancer

Carcinogenesis, the process that leads to cancer, is believed to occur in a series of steps. It is a multistage process that begins with precan- cerous cellular damage that gradually proceeds to more malignant changes. The first step is the development of cellular abnormalities, which eventually leads to cancer. This usually occurs during adolescence, and soon after puberty. __Remember that unhealthy childhood nutritional practices cause excessive sex hormone production and early pathologic changes in the breast tissue that set the stage for cancer many years later.__

We know that puberty at an earlier age is a significant marker of increased risk, and we know that there is overwhelming evidence that ovarian hormones play a crucial role, at all stages, in the development of breast cancer. __It is common knowledge among physicians that the earlier a woman matures, as measured by the age of her first menstrual period, the higher her risk for breast cancer.__ Both early menarche and greater body weight are markers of increased risk of breast cancer.

__Women are not the only sex affected; the same increased risk as a result of early maturation is seen with both prostate cancer and testicular cancer.__ If we grow and mature more rapidly, we increase our cancer risk and age faster. We see the same thing in lab animals;if we feed them so they grow faster, they die younger.

A greater consumption of animal foods leads to a higher level of hormones related to early reproductive function and growth
These hormonal abnormalities persist into adulthood.  Uterine fibroids also develop from a diet deficient in fruits and vegetables and heavy in meat. As the consumption of meat increases and vegetation decreases, one's risk of fibroids increases proportionately. In other words, the stage is set by our poor dietary habits early in life. Breast and prostate cancer are strongly affected by our dietary practices when we are young.

In China, animal-food consumption correlated well with early menarche and increasing levels of sex hormones. Serum testosterone levels had the best correlation with breast cancer, even better than estrogen. Of note is that increasing levels of testosterone significantly increases the risk of both breast cancer and prostate cancer. Testos- terone rises as well with increasing levels of obesity, and being over weight is another consistent risk factor.

__Cheese has more saturated fat and more hormone-containing and promoting substances than any other food, and the incidence of our hormonally sensitive cancers has skyrocketed.__

##### Unraveling the Protein Myth

The public as well as the media are confused about this issue. They continue to associate the term better nutrition with earlier matu- rity and larger stature resulting from our greater consumption of animal protein and animal fats. These unfavorable trends are repeat- edly reported as positive events. Earlier writers and nutritionists have mistakenly equated rapid growth with health. I believe an increased rate of growth is not a good thing. The slower a child grows, the slower he or she is aging. Slower growth, taking longer to reach maturity, is predictive of a longer life in animal studies. We are finding  the same thing in humans: an unnaturally rapid growth and premature puberty are risk factors for cancers and other diseases later in life. Evidence continues to mount that these same factors leading to early maturity and excessive growth in childhood increase the occurrence of cancer in general, not just breast and prostate cancer. Excluding malnutrition or serious disease, the slower we grow and mature, the longer we live. 

The other side of the story is that in the past ten years it is not just the fat in animal foods that causes cancer and heart disease. Animal protein is also getting a bad rap by legitimate nutritional researchers and scientists in studies. Scientists have discovered a link between animal protein and cancer in both laboratory and human epidemio- logical studies, and reducing one's consumption of animal protein slows the aging process.

##### Exercise Powerfully Reduces Cancer Risk


Researchers  report that women who exercise regularly reduce their risk of developing breast cancer substantially. Their study involved more than 25,000 women age twenty to fifty-four at the time of their entry into the study. The researchers found that younger, premenopausal women (under forty-five years old) who exercised regularly had 62 percent less risk than sedentary women. The risk reduction was highest for lean women who exercised more than four hours per week; these women had a 72 percent reduction in risk.

Researchers looking for answers to these questions studied women with cancer and found that saturated fat in the diet promoted a more rapid spread of the cancer. Other researchers found similar results. For a woman who already has cancer, her risk of dying increased 40 percent for every 1,000 grams of fat consumed monthly. Studies also indicate that high fruit and vegetable intake improved survival, and fat on the body increases the risk of a premature death。

Today the link between animal products and many different diseases is as strongly supported in the scientific literature as the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.

The other side of the story is that in the past ten years it is not just the fat in animal foods that causes cancer and heart disease. Animal protein is also getting a bad rap by legitimate nutritional researchers and scientists in studies. Scientists have discovered a link between animal protein and cancer in both laboratory and human epidemio- logical studies, and reducing one's consumption of animal protein slows the aging process.

##### Are Dairy Foods Protecting Us fromOsteoporosis？

__Hip fractures and osteoporosis are more frequent in populations in which dairy products are commonly consumed and calcium in- takes are commonly high. On the contrary, studies show fruits and vegetables are protective against osteoporosis.__

A negative calcium balance means more calcium is excreted in the urine than is absorbed through digestion. A positive calcium bal- ance means more calcium is absorbed than is excreted. A negative balance over time results in bone loss, as the additional calcium must come from our primary calcium storehouse, our bones. __Epidemiologic studies have linked osteoporosis not to low cal- cium intake but to various nutritional factors that cause excessive calcium loss in the urine.__ The continual depletion of our calcium re- serves over time, from excessive calcium excretion in the urine, is the primary cause of osteoporosis.

Published data clearly links increased urinary excretion of calcium with animal-protein intake but not with vegetable-protein intake. Plant foods, though some may be high in protein, are not acid-forming. Animal-protein ingestion results in a heavy acid load in the blood. This sets off a series of reactions whereby calcium is re- leased from the bones to help neutralize the acid. The sulfur-based amino acids in animal products contribute significantly to urinary acid production and the resulting calcium loss. The Nurses Health Study found that women who consumed 95 grams of protein a day had a 22 percent greater risk of forearm fracture than those who consumed less than 68 grams.

##### Got Milk — Or Leave It?

Dairy is best kept to a minimum. There are many good reasons not to consume dairy. For example, there is a strong association between dairy lactose and ischemic heart disease. There is also an association between high-growth-promoling foods such as dairy products and cancer. There is a clear association between milk consumption and testicular cancer. Dairy fat is also loaded with various toxins and is the primary source of our nation's high exposure to dioxin. Dioxin is a highly toxic chemical compound that even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency admits is a prominent cause of many types of cancer in those consuming dairy fat, such as butter and cheese.

# Are You Dying to Lose Weight? A CLOSER LOOK AT THE ATKINS PLAN, THE ZONE, AND EATING FOR YOUR BLOOD TYPE, THEY Don't work!

To make matters even worse, you pay an extra penalty from a diet so high in fat and protein to generate a chronic ketosis. Besides the increased cancer risk, your kidneys are placed under greater stress and will age more rapidly. It can take many, many years for such damage to be detected by blood tests. By the time the blood reflects the ab- normality, irreversible damage may have already occurred. Blood tests that monitor kidney function typically do not begin to detect prob- lems until more than 90 percent of the kidneys have been destroyed.

Protein is metabolized by the liver, and the nitrogenous wastes generated are broken down and then excreted by the kidney. These wastes must be eliminated for the body to maintain normal purity and a stable state of equilibrium. Most doctors are taught in medical school that a high-protein diet ages the kidney. What has been accepted as the normal age-related loss in renal function may really be a cumulative injury secondary to the heavy pressure imposed on the kidney by our high-protein eating habits.

# Nutritional Wisdom Makes You Thin

### UnrefinedCarbohydratesEncourageWeight Loss

Our bodies need carbohydrates more than any other substance. Our muscle cells and brains are designed to run on carbohydrate. Carbohydrate-rich foods, when consumed in their natural state, a low in calories and high in fiber compared with fatty foods, processe foods, or animal products.

Fat contains about nine calories per gram, but protein and carbo- hydrates contain approximately four calories per gram. So when you eat high-carbohydrate foods, such as fresh fruits and beans, you can eat more food and still keep your caloric intake relatively low. __Th high fiber content of (unrefined) carbohydrate-rich food is anoth crucial reason you will feel more satisfied and not crave more fo when you make unrefined carbohydrates the main source of calorie in your diet.__


Protein, fat, and carbohydrates are called macronutrients. Vitamins and minerals are referred to as micronutrients. __All plant foods are a mixture of protein, fat, and carbohydrate (the macronutrients). Even a banana contains about 3.5 percent protein, almost the same as mother's milk. Fruit and starchy vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, corn, carrots, and butternut squash, are predominantly carbohydrate but also contain some fat and protein. Green vegetables are about half protein, a quarter carbohydrate, and a quarter fat. Legumes and beans are about half carbohydrate, a quarter protein, and a quarter fat.__

One of the principles behind the health and weight-loss formula in this book is not to be overly concerned about the macronutrient balance; if you eat healthful foods, you will automatically get enough of all three macronutrients as long as you do not consume too many calories from white flour, sugar, and oil. __So don't fear eating foods rich in carbohydrates and don't be afraid of eating fruit because it contains sugar.__ Even the plant foods that are high in carbohydrate contain sufficient fiber and nutrients and are low enough in calories to be considered nutritious. As long as they are unrefined, they should not be excluded from your diet. In fact, it is impossible to glean all the nutrients needed for optimal health if your diet does not contain lots of carbohydrate-rich food.


Fresh fruits, beans and legumes, whole grains, and root vegeta- bles are all examples of foods whose calories come mainly from car- bohydrate. It is the nutrient-per-calorie ratio of these foods that determines their food value. There is nothing wrong with carbohy- drates; it is the empty-calorie, or refined, carbohydrates that are re- sponsible for the bad reputation of carbs.

##### Understanding the Concept of Caloric Density

__When subjects eating foods low in caloric density, such as fruits and vegetables, are compared with those consuming foods richer in calories, those on meal plans with higher calorie concentrations were found to consume twice as many calories per day in order to satisfy their hunger.__

Your body must burn about 23 percent of the calories consume! from carbohydrates to make the conversion from glucose into fat, but it converts food fat into body fat quickly and easily. __One hundred calories of ingested fat can be converted to ninety-seven calories of body fat, burning a measly three calories. So the fat you eat is easily and rapidly stored by the body.__

__Green vegetables are so incredibly low in calories and rich in nutrients and fiber that the more you eat of them, the more weight you will lose. One of my secrets to nutritional excellence and superior health is the one pound-one pound rule. That is, try to eat at least one pound of raw green vegetables a day and one pound of cooked/ steamed or frozen green vegetables  as well. One pound raw and one pound cooked — keep this goal in mind as you design and eat every meal. This may be too ambitious a goal for some of u to reach, but by working toward it, you will ensure the dietary bal- ance and results you want. The more greens you eat, the more weight you will lose. The high volume of greens not only will be your secret to a thin waistline but will simultaneously protect you against life- threatening illnesses.__

Vegetables have powerful levels of carotenoids and other nutrients that prevent age-related diseases. For example, the leading cause of age-related blindness in America is macular degeneration. If you eat greens at least five times per week, your risk drops by more than 86 percent. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids with powerful disease-prevention properties. Researchers have found that those with the highest blood levels of lutein had the healthiest blood vessels, with little or no atherosclerosis.


It is true that most of us eat too much fat, but scientific research is vealing that too little fat can be a problem, too. We have learned t not merely are we consuming too much fat but, more important, are consuming the wrong fats. Americans consume too much of some bad fats and not enough of other fats that we need to maximize health.

Optimal health depends on the proper balance of fatty acids in the diet. The modern diet that most of us eat supplies an excessive amount of omega-6 fat, but often too little omega-3 fat. This relative deficiency of omega-3 fats has potentially serious implications. Also, the con- sumption of too much omega-6 fat leads to high levels of arachidonic acid (AA). Higher levels of arachidonic acid can promote inflammation.

##### There's Something Fishy about Fish Oils

Most of the publicity about the beneficial effects of essential fats has focused on fish oils, which are rich in EPA, an omega-3 fat. One problem with fish oils is that much of the fat has already turned ran- cid. If you have ever cut open a capsule of fish oil and tasted it, you will find it tastes like gasoline. Not only are many people intolerant of the burping, indigestion, and smelling like a fish, but it is also pos- sible that the rancidity of the fat places a stress on the liver. I have noted abnormal liver function on the blood tests of a few patients who were taking fish oil tablets. These few patients had their liver function return to normal when they stopped taking the fish oils.

Large amounts of fish oils inhibit immune function." Lowering the function of natural killer cells is not a good thing, as our defenses against infection and cancer diminish. Because of this immune sup- pression, as well as the toxicity issues, I do not routinely recommend that my patients take fish oil capsules — though there are a few ex- ceptions.

##### Does Fish Prevent Heart Disease?

There are two components to a heart attack or stroke. First, you must develop atherosclerotic plaque. This plaque builds up over many years from eating a diet deficient in unrefined plant foods. Almost all Americans have such plaque. Autopsy studies demonstrate atherosclerosis even in the vast majority of American children.

Once these fatty plaques accumulate and partially block a coronary artery, a clot can develop in a defect or crack in the surface of the plaque. This clot is called a thrombus, which can enlarge and completely block the vessel, causing a heart attack, or break off and travel upstream, obstructing a more distal coronary site. A traveling thrombus is called an embolus. Emboli and thrombi are the cause of almost all heart attacks and strokes.

__However, the best way to prevent a heart attack or stroke is to follow a high-nutrient diet with little or no animal products, thereby ensuring that such blockages don't develop in the first place.__

__The bottom line: Choose fish over other animal products, but be aware that the place where it was caught, and the type of fish, matters. Don't accept recreational fish from questionable waters. Farmed fish is safer. Never eat high-mercury-content fish. Don't eat fish more than twice a week, and if you have a family history of hemor- rhagic stroke, limit it further to only once a month.__

##### Extracted Oils, One Slick Customer

__Americans consume large quantities of oil, a refined food, processed at high temperatures. When oils are subject to heat, the chemical structure of the essential fatty acids are changed to toxic derivatives known as lipid peroxides and other toxic and potentially cancer-causing by-products. Clearly, it is best to avoid fried foods and heated oils, not only because they will destroy your chances to achieve a normal weight but because they are also potentially cancer-causing.__

Get your fats as nature packaged them. It is best to consume the little fats we need in their original unprocessed, unheated, and natu- ral packages: whole food. Ground flaxseed is healthier than flaxseed oil, as it contains valuable fiber, lignans, and other phytonutrients, not just omega-3 fat. Raw sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, corn, olives, and avocados are healthy, but their extracted oils may not be. Even cold-pressed oils are subject to the damaging effects of heat and contain lipid peroxides. So I usually recommend to my patients that instead of consuming the oils, they consume a tablespoon of ground flaxseed daily, or some walnuts, to ensure adequate omega-3 fat in- take.

Remember, when you extract the oil from the whole food it was packaged in, you remove it from its antioxidant- and phytochemical- rich protective environment. You turn a moderate nutrient-to-calorie food into a low nutrient-to-calorie food, and at the same time dam- age the quality of the fat with heat. Romaine lettuce, kale, collards, and Swiss chard are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, vegetable protein, and essential fats — again, another reason I con- sider leafy green vegetables the king of all foods.

##### Is Therean Increased Risko f Stroke from Low-Fat Diets?

Let me remind you that the best fats are the monounsaturated fats and essential fats (omega-3 and omega-6) present in whole, nat- ural plant foods, including avocados, olives, and raw nuts and seeds. Studies continue to show that consumption of raw nuts protects against both heart attack and stroke, without the risks of increasing heart disease and cancer, as is the case with the high consumption of animal-origin fats. When the fats you consume are from whole food, rather than oil, you gain nature's protective package: a balance of vitamins, minerals, fibers, and phytonutrients.

##### Trans Fat: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
