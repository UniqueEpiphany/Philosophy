The __Treaty of Versailles__ was a peace treaty between the nations, Japan, the United States, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Britain after World War I. The treaty was made in 1919. Germany, Austria and Hungary did not participate writing it. Germany had the choice between signing it or facing the occupation of Germany by Allied troops. This was known as a diktat Frieden. This angered the German people as they believed that they did not start the war.

The French made the Treaty hard for the Germans so that Germany would not be able to start a new war. Thus, Germany had to reduce its armed forces from 6 million to 100,000 men, and get rid of its submarines, military aircraft and most of their artillery. Their Navy battleships were limited to only six small ones.

Germany also had to give back French territories it had occupied, as well as large territories of its own to Poland, for instance, and all of its colonies. A heavy economical burden for Germany was to pay back the very big World War I reparations for the damage done to Allied countries, mostly France, during World War I by German troops. This sum was not fixed. 132 billion gold marks had to be paid only as a first part of the German debt.

The Treaty made a __League of Nations__, which decided things after the treaty was signed. It solved some international disputes without war, but could not stop World War II.

This Treaty can be seen as a one-sided peace, dictated for Germany. Germany's nationalists and Adolf Hitler later persuaded the Germans to get rid of the "chains of Versailles." After Hitler became Chancellor, he gave orders to disobey the treaty. His actions eventually led to World War II.

### Long-term problems

The __German Empire__ became the __Weimar Republic__. A big problem for Germany was to pay back a giant amount of money for the all of the damage done to the Allied countries, mostly France, during World War I. This made Germany one of the poorest countries in Europe for almost 20 years, and caused political fighting in Germany. The two most important parties, the Communists (who wanted a Communist revolution as had happened in Russia) and the Nazis (who thought Germany should become the most powerful country in Europe) fought for many years.

The debt to the Allies was made easier for the Germans during the Great Depression, and all debt was cancelled in 1932. Many Germans hated the treaty and some even wanted to fight more after Versailles.

The League of Nations created after Versailles was usually not powerful enough to stop wars, either. Japan took a part of China called Manchuria and the League was not able to stop it. Italy invaded Ethiopia and although the Ethiopian Emperor begged the League to help him, it did not. Germany, Japan and Italy became the Axis powers, and by invading many peaceful countries caused World War II. The United States and the USSR did not even join the League, even though it was the idea of US President Woodrow Wilson in the first place. The League was never taken seriously, even though it was created to make sure Versailles was respected.

The treaty failed to keep peace in the end, and was a reason for Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler to win the support of the poorer Germans to get rid of the "chains of Versailles", leading to World War II.

# Breaking the Treaty

Hitler transformed Germany. He had two major goals: to create a powerful new German empire and to rid the country of Jews. During his first three years in power, Hitler changed Germany from a poor, defeated, ashamed nation into a thriving and proud country. Above all, Germany had a powerful new army. Under the Versailles Treaty, the German army war limited to 100,000 men, but Hitler scorned the treaty. By 1936 his army totaled around 400,000. That was the first action that led the treaty to be untrusted anymore. The second reason was, Hitler promised to invade only the Sudetenland city (part in Czechoslovakia), but indeed, he invaded not only the Sudetenland but all of the Czechoslovakia.
