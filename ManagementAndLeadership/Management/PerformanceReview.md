Reviewing performance is a critical competency for a manager to be effective, yet it also can be difficult. Most employees care about how their performance is perceived by management. Naturally, they resist and dislike being told that they either committed errors or are not capable in certain areas. Managers who are effective at reviewing others' performance understand how essential the formal performance review process is, prepare thoroughly, and do a thorough job. Managers who are not particularly effective avoid this part of their role, push it off onto others (usually human resources or an assistant manager), or do an incomplete job.

The recent "Great Places To Work Survey" shows that great employers have the following in common.

* Management makes its expectations clear.
* Management provides training and development opportunities to employees.
* Management's actions match its words.
* Employees are given responsibility.

The perfect opportunity for a manager to communicate clear expectations, outline training and development opportunities, and establish goals and related responsibilities is in the performance review process. However, the standard once-a-year performance review is flawed because of the following.

* Managers typically don't like having to prepare the usually lengthy document and spend time to actually conduct the review.
* The review meetings make employees (and sometimes managers) nervous.
* Meeting once a year doesn't build consistent feedback and coaching into the process.
* The review meeting becomes a "data dump," especially for immature or inexperienced managers.
* The whole process tends to be a subjective "judging" act that doesn't clearly define success, expectations, and growth opportunities.

Essentially, two kinds of performance reviews exist: informal and formal reviews. A manager informally reviews someone's work when he or she talks about the person's performance in an unstructured, soon-after-the-fact meeting. While it may be scheduled, it is essentially a review concerning a specific task or how the person handled a particular incident. Formal reviews are scheduled (usually once a year) and are typically done by all managers during the same time period in the year. They are designed to review the person's performance for an entire year and are "official." Typically, a written report is produced and entered into the person's personnel file. This article will focus on best practices and recommendations for conducting and leading formal performance reviews.
