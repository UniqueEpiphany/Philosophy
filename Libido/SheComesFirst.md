Recommend book : She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman by Ian Kerner

# Introduction: Confessions of a Premature Ejaculator

THE PREMISE of this book is simple: when it comes to pleasuring women and conversing in the language of love, cunnilingus should be every man's native tongue. As bestselling sex author Lou Paget has written, “Ask most women, and if they're being honest, they will admit that what makes them hottest and come hardest is when a man can use his tongue well.”

__Not only do women crave and enjoy cunnilingus; they require it. Any sex therapist will tell you that the number one complaint they hear over and over from women is of an inability to experience orgasm during penis-vagina intercourse.__ The solution is not simply “more foreplay,” as magazines often chide us, but rather the skillful extension of those activities we associate with foreplay, namely oral stimulation, into complete, fully realized acts of lovemaking—the transformation of foreplay into nothing less than core-play.

She Comes First offers men and women a surefire “bird in the hand” approach to good sex, as opposed to the high-stakes “all or nothing” proposition of intercourse. It's time to close the sex gap and create a level playing field in the exchange of pleasure, and cunnilingus is far more than just a means for achieving this noble end; it's the cornerstone of a new sexual paradigm, one that exuberantly extols a shared experience of pleasure, intimacy, respect and contentment. It's also one of the greatest gifts of love a man can bestow upon a woman.

### A Taste of What's to Come

In the spirit of Elements of Style, here are a few basic rules to get you started:

1. Learn to Appreciate Irony: because when it comes to human sexuality, life abounds with it. Just for starters, take the fact that men and women's genitals are formed from the same embryonic tissue, yet our respective processes of arousal couldn't be more different. As the founding editors of Men's Health magazine, Stefan Bechtel and Laurence Roy Stains, so succinctly put it in their book Sex: A Man's Guide, “Studies show that three fourths of men are finished with sex within a few minutes of starting. But women often need 15 minutes or more to become sufficiently aroused for orgasm. And therein lies a world of rage, grief, and airborne pots and pans.”

2. Don't Mistake Her Subject for an Object: namely, the clitoris. With its eight thousand nerve endings (twice as many as the penis), enviable ability to produce multiple orgasms during a single session of sex, and no known purpose other than pleasure, is it any wonder that Masters and Johnson proclaimed the clitoris “a unique organ in the total of humanity”? The clitoris has over eighteen parts, both visible and hidden, that participate in the production of pleasure. (Keep reading, and you'll learn how to master each and every one of them.) Contrary to conventional wisdom—at least the kind that's as common as Ben-Gay and mildew in the men's locker room—the clitoris is much more than just a “love button,” it's a sophisticated network of arousal that has more hot spots than a latent volcano.

3. The Tongue Is Mightier than the Sword: especially when it comes to clitoral stimulation. Even porn star Ron Jeremy, in possession of the famous ten-inch member, observed, “More women have gotten off with my tongue than with my penis.” Shere Hite, author of the Hite Report on Sexuality, went so far as to suggest, “Intercourse was never meant to stimulate women to orgasm.” One of the reasons for this is that the clitoris is about 2 to 3 cm closer to the front of the woman's body than the vaginal opening. During intercourse, the penis often misses the clitoris altogether.

In Sex: A Man's Guide, the authors cite a study in which ninety- eight wives in happy, stable marriages kept a sex diary that noted the frequency of sexual activity and the level of satisfaction. Of all the activities they mentioned, cunnilingus ranked as the most satisfying.

Eighty-two percent said having their husbands pleasure them orally was very satisfying; the next highest activity, intercourse, was rated very satisfying by only 68 percent. The women reported that during intercourse they reached orgasm about 25 percent of the time. But they reached orgasm 81 percent of the time during oral sex. As Dr. Alex Comfort wrote of cunnilingus in The New Joy of Sex, “One can give the woman dozens of orgasms in this way and she may still want to go on from there.”

Today, I am convinced that one of the main sources of PE(premature ejaculation) is poor masturbation habits—how boys are taught, or rather not taught, to do it quickly, furtively, and shrouded in taboo and secrecy. It doesn't take long for a young man to program himself to seek his pleasure quickly, and as we all know, bad habits are difficult to break. Perhaps if someone had told me early on to masturbate with a woman's orgasm in mind, rather than my own, I would have been spared years of turmoil.

#  1. She comes first, the courtesy that counts

The female orgasm is a more complicated affair and often takes much longer to achieve during a session of sexual activity. In particular, her first orgasm is the most difficult to accomplish, requiring persistent stimulation, concentration, and relaxation. Is it any surprise, then, that researchers from the University of Chicago declared in the 1994 Sex in America Survey that men reach orgasm during intercourse far more consistently than do women, and that three fourths of men, but less than a third of women, always have orgasms. Less than a third! That means more than two out of three women on average are consistently denied their climax.

__Irony, bitter and cruel, seems to be embedded into our respective processes of arousal: that a woman, so unique in her sexuality, possessing both a clitoris—an organ designed solely for the production of pleasure—as well as the ability to experience multiple orgasms during a single session of sexual activity, should so often find this vast potential for blazing ecstasy smoldered—a magnificent conflagration left unlit—all for lack of a match that can hold its flame.__

It's not a problem with the match, say many men, but rather that a woman's fuse is too long. Perhaps, but then this raises the question how long is too long? __Studies, like those by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, have concluded that among women whose partners spent twenty-one minutes or longer on foreplay, only 7.7 percent failed to reach orgasm consistently. That's a shift of tectonic proportions— from two out of three women not being able to reach climax to nine out of ten achieving satisfaction—all because of a matter of minutes.__

Few, if any, of the world's problems can be solved with a mere twenty minutes of attention, and yet here, in the complex sociopolitical landscape of the bedroom, we have an opportunity to create bilateral satisfaction. When put that way, in the context of sexual peace and equality, is twenty minutes of focused attention, applied appropriately, really too much to ask, especially if it can save your sex life?

# 2. Her Clitoris, the little engine that could

![alt](http://media.gettyimages.com/illustrations/perinium-illustration-illustration-id487737753)

There's more to the clitoris than meets the eye. Much more. Don't mistake the hooded crown (the “glans” or “head”) for the entire clitoris. As we will discuss, the head is just the tip of the iceberg, a tantalizing allusion to unseen wells of pleasure.

Like a Greek column, the clitoris has three components—a head, a shaft, and a base—that extend throughout the pelvic area, with visible structures encompassing the entire area of the vulva, from the top of the pubic bone down to the anus, as well as unseen parts inside the vaginal area. In their landmark work, A New View of a Woman's Body: A Fully Illustrated Guide, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers identified eighteen structures in the clitoral network, some visible, some hidden.

__With more than eight thousand nerve fibers, the clitoris has more of these than any other part of the human body and interacts with the fifteen thousand nerve fibers that service the entire pelvic area.__ This vast erogenous landscape literally throbs with potential pleasure. As science writer Natalie Angier writes of the clitoral network, “Nerves are like wolves or birds: if one starts crying, there goes the neighborhood.” So stop thinking of the clitoris as a little bump, and start thinking of it as a complex network, a pleasure dome, the Xanadu at the heart of female sexuality.

__Because it's all that and more. When engorged with blood during sexual arousal, the clitoris increases in size, just like a penis. In fact, the clitoris was created from the same embryonic tissue as the penis, and can be compared point by point with the male genitalia. And unlike the penis—burdened with the responsibilities of reproduction and the removal of waste—the clitoris is devoted solely to pleasure and confers upon the female “an infinitely greater capacity for sexual response than a man ever dreamed of.” __

# 3. Think Outside Her Box

__The deep interior walls of the vagina really have few nerve endings and are quite insensitive when stroked or lightly pressed.” But when gently touched on their clitorises, 98 percent of women were aware of it.__

# 4. The Female Orgasm: Keep it Simple

IN THE LORE of female sexuality, a lot of fuss is made over the differences between clitoral, G-spot, and blended and vaginal orgasms. The clitoral orgasm is often criticized as being quick and lighthearted, while the others are somehow deemed more serious and substantial. But a quick study of anatomy reveals that all orgasms are clitoral. The clitoris is the sexual epicenter, an orgasmic powerhouse in which no sensation goes unnoticed. As Natalie Angier writes of the infamous G-spot, the area of soft tissue just inside the vaginal area, “The roots of the clitoris run deep, after all, and very likely can be tickled through posterior agitation. In other words, the G-spot may be nothing more than the back end of the clitoris.”

As for vaginal orgasms and the moans of pleasure that often accompany penetration, sorry to burst your bubble, gentlemen: while we'd like to believe that these sensations of excruciating ecstasy are being delivered from the depths of her vagina by the sheer power and reach of our formidable thrusts, they are actually “caused by pressure on the parts of the clitoris that surround the vaginal opening,” what author Rebecca Chalker refers to as the “clitoral cuff.” When this highly sensitized area is aroused and engorged with blood, a horseshoe like arch forms at the vaginal opening and applies friction and pressure against the male penis, playing a pivotal role in the stimulation of the male orgasm. So, in one sense, both the female and the male orgasm depend on the clitoris for stimulation.

# 5. The tongue is mightier than the sword

NUMEROUS STUDIES have demonstrated that women whose lovers give them direct clitoral stimulation during sexual activity are more likely to climax consistently. But because of its location, most sexual positions (especially missionary-style) do not properly stimulate the clitoris. As Shere Hite concluded, “Sex provides efficiently for male orgasm, and inefficiently for female orgasm.”

> In Sex: A Man's Guide the authors conclude, “One of the biggest revelations of the Men's Health magazine survey was the number of men who said that oral sex is the best way to ring her chimes. Over and over again, we heard such things as 'oral sex is the only method that consistently enables my wife to reach orgasm' or 'if a man knows how to give outstanding oral sex, then a woman will reach orgasm every time.’”

Most men consider cunnilingus an aspect of foreplay, an appetizer to be served before the main meal of genital intercourse. But according to author Paula Kamen, “In a study of sexually knowledgeable and experienced women who use a vibrator, the most common type of stimulation that usually or always triggers an orgasm is oral sex.”

__Regardless of how we categorize it, we need to understand that cunnilingus is a complete process that takes a woman through the gamut of sexual response. Later, in Part H, cunnilingus will be referred to as coreplay—the centerpiece of the “play process”—with foreplay encompassing those activities prior to the first “genital kiss.”__

“The penis is very badly placed, anatomically speaking, when it comes to making women come. Better if men simply left their penis alone, stopped attending to those immature nerve fibers, and concentrated instead on learning how to orgasm through their tongues.” (Tisdale)

The __Mons Pubis__. We begin our journey, north, at the mons pubis, also known as the “mons veneris” (mountain of Venus), named after the Roman goddess of love. The mons pubis is a thick pad of fatty tissue, covered in pubic hair, which is sometimes called the love mound because it forms a soft mound over the pubic bone.

The __Labia Majora__. Heading south from the mons pubis, we next encounter the starting point of the labia majora (major lips). The outer sides of the labia majora, also known as the outer lips, are rich with pubic hair, whereas their inner sides are smooth, lined with oil and sweat glands. Beneath the skin of the outer lips is a network of erectile tissue that engorges with blood during arousal. The outer lips are analogous to the male scrotum, and both were formed from the same embryonic tissue. Although sensitive to touch, the outer lips are not nearly as sensitive as the labia minora (small lips) or other parts of the clitoral network such as the head and shaft.

The __Front Commissure__. The outer lips mark an area where the visible parts of the clitoris begin. This highly sensitive area, just above the clitoral head, is called the front commissure, and it's from this point that the clitoral shaft—an unseen, but instrumental part of the clitoris—protrudes.

The __Labia Minora__. Enfolded within the labia majora are the labia minora (little lips), although many insist that it's more apt to refer to both sets of lips respectively as outer and inner, rather than big and little, since the inner lips sometimes protrude out and beyond the outer lips. Interestingly, the inner lips are also archaically known as “nymphae,” named after the nymphs of ancient Greece who were famous for their irrepressible libidos and are the source of the term “nymphomania.”

The inner lips enfold and surround the clitoral glans (the head), the urethral opening, and the introitus (entrance) to the vagina. Like the inner side of the labia majora, these smaller, inner lips have no hair, but are layered with oil glands that look and feel like tiny bumps. Dense with nerves, the inner lips are extremely sensitive and play an important role in the process of arousal.

The inner lips are remarkably diverse in size and appearance. From woman to woman, and often on the same woman, no two lips are the same. Some lips are narrow; others wide; some curl inward, others flare outward. Sometimes the texture is glossy and smooth, sometimes wrinkled and bumpy. During the process of arousal, the inner lips change color, from light pink to darker hues, and swell and puff in size as they engorge with blood.

The __Hood__. The outer edges of the inner lips meet just above the sensitive clitoral head to form the well-known protective hood (which is analogous to the foreskin of the penis), also known as the prepuce. The friction created when the clitoral hood rubs against the head is a powerful source of stimulation and pleasure. The hood also protects the head from overstimulation; just prior to the release of orgasm, it's into the folds of the hood that the head seeks refuge.

The __Frenulum__. Below the head, the inner edges of the labia minora meet to form the frenulum, a small expanse of soft, sensitive skin, also known as the bridle. Like the inner lips, this area is rich in nerve fibers and is extremely sensitive to the touch.

The __Fourchette__. The bottom edges of the lips meet beneath the vaginal entrance in an area known as the fourchette, or little fork. dust as the front commisure marks the top part of the visible clitoris, the fourchette marks the bottom.



The __Clitoral Glans (the head)__. Protected by the hood of the inner lips, he head is the crown jewel that rests atop the unseen shaft and crura (the legs). __With approximately eight thousand nerve endings, twice as many as the head of the penis and more than any other part of the human body, the head is the visible part of a woman's clitoris that ofen gets referred to as the “love button.” It's not a bad term; just remember that it applies to only one part of the clitoris—the head.__

__One of the biggest mistakes a lover can make is to underestimate the sensitivity of the clitoral head. In fact, at the peak of sexual arousal, the head becomes so sensitive that, with a little help from the suspensory ligament (an unseen part of the of the clitoris), it retracts beneath its hood and is often hidden at the moment of climax.__

Some heads are large; others are small. Size varies greatly, just as it does with the male penis. But regardless of size and shape, all contain the same number of nerve endings, so clitoral dimensions have no impact on a woman's sensitivity.
There's quite a bit of contention over the etymology of the word “clitoris.” Some believe it stems from the Greek, kleitoris, meaning “little hill or slope”; others say it comes from the Greek verb kleitoriazein, meaning “to touch or titillate lasciviously, to be inclined to pleasure”; and still others claim that the Greek word kleitoris originally meant “divine and goddesslike.” In some sense, all these meanings are true.

__Perineum__. The perineum is the small expanse of skin just above the anus and just beneath the vaginal entrance (sometimes referred to casually as the “taint,” because “it t'aint one or the other”). __Beneath the skin of the perineum is a network of blood vessels and tissue, which fill with blood during arousal and become intensely sensitive. Dr. Kinsey observed during his research that the perineum is “highly sensitive to touch, and tactile stimulation of the area may provide considerable erotic arousal.” When making your travel plans of the clitoral network, make sure to include this southern hot spot.__

# 10. Now You Don't: Female Sexual Anatomy Part 2

The __Clitoral Body__. Attached to the head, and running just beneath the surface of the skin, the clitoral shaft can easily be felt, especially when aroused and filled with blood. A soft little pipe, the shaft is composed of spongy erectile tissue that is extremely receptive to sensation. The shaft extends north from the head toward the mons pubis for about three quarters of an inch before forking and dividing like a wishbone into two thin crura (or legs) that flare downward along the path of the inner lips and surround twin bulbs of erectile tissue, known as the clitoral bulbs.

If you've ever noticed that the clitoral head seems to retract and disappear under its protective hood during peak arousal, that's because the suspensory ligament—attached to the head at one end and the ovaries at the other—is being stretched, causing the head to retract.

Additionally, the clitoris has layers of muscle, usually referred to as vaginal muscles or pelvic floor muscles. There is the oval-shaped bulbocavernous muscle that rests between the inner lips and the bulbs of the clitoris. This muscle is interwoven with muscle that encircles the anus, and is part of the reason that anal stimulation is often a turn-on and hence part of the clitoral network.

Underneath it all is a broad, flat layer of muscle called the pubococcygeus (pew-bo-cok-SIH-gee-us) or __PC muscle__. The PC muscle is also known as the “Kegel” muscle, named after Dr. Arnold Kegel who observed that the PC muscle contracts during orgasm. Kegel subsequently developed a series of exercises designed to strengthen the pelvic muscles and heighten pleasure for both partners, hence the birth of “Kegels.” In both men and women, the PC muscle is easily identified as the one that allows us to stop the flow of urine.

# 11. Avoid “G-Spotty” Logic

LET'S TALK about spot removal, G-spot removal that is. Starting at the urethral opening, and running about two inches deep to the bladder, is the urethra, which first and foremost enables the removal of urine. Surrounding the urethra is a ring of spongy erectile tissue, known as corpus spongiosum, which fills with blood (luring arousal and protects the urethra from the friction of penetration. This area of spongy tissue is also known as the much-ballyhooed G-spot, named in 1944 after Dr. Ernst Grafenberg, who described a “zone of erogenous feeling . . . located along the suburethral surface of the anterior vaginal wall.” In layman's terms, Dr. Kinsey observed, “Most of those women who did notice some response had the sensitivity confined to a certain point, in most cases the upper wall of the vagina just inside the vaginal entrance.” For all its hype, the G- spot, as cited earlier, may simply be nothing more than the roots of the clitoris crisscrossing the urethral sponge.
While sensitive to stimulation, but without nearly as many nerve endings as the clitoral head, the G-spot generally responds to a more persistent, massaging pressure. It's not uncommon for a woman to feel a fleeting urge to urinate when this area is stimulated.

A whole lot of fuss has been made over the difference between a clitoral orgasm and a G-spot orgasm, with many claiming that the latter is responsible for the production of the fuller vaginal orgasm. This hubbub reached its apex with the publication in 1982 of the The G Spot by Alice Kahn Ladas, Beverly Whipple, and Dr. John Perry. In retrospect, it's possible to argue that all their book ultimately accomplished was to reintroduce a spruced-up, hyped-up theory of vaginal orgasm into the mainstream, with the added bonus of female ejaculation. Of course it was a cultural sensation; the notion of a G- spot dovetailed seamlessly into the “intercourse discourse” and gave penetration a new, invigorated raison d'être. Is that revolutionary, or just plain reactionary?

As we discussed earlier, the whole idea of a mature vaginal orgasm vs. an immature clitoral one was a bogus construct to begin with, promulgated by Freud, perpetuated by his followers, and reinvented and sensationalized in the form of the G-spot. And although the urethral sponge is indeed attached to the vaginal ceiling, it is nevertheless considered an integral part of the clitoral network and not a separate part of the vagina that produces pleasure. A G- spot orgasm, like all female orgasms, is a clitoral orgasm; it's part of the same pleasure network. As such, when we address the techniques in Part II, this book will make a somewhat radical break from the tradition of erotological literature by referring to the area that is generally known as the G-spot as the “clitoral cluster,” a name that more accurately, and simply, expresses its anatomical power and role in the process of female sexual response.

# 12. When Raindrops Keep Falling on Your Head: Female Ejaculation

T HE G-SPOT is also thought to be the source of female ejaculation, another matter of controversy. Does a woman actually ' ejaculate? The answer is yes, but not in the same sense as the explosive male orgasm and not nearly as often as the “ejaculation evangelists” would have us believe. In general, female ejaculation appears to be the exception rather than the rule.Today, a whole industry has emerged around the concept, pitching a vast array of hooks, tapes, videos, and seminars that urge women to discover and master their ejaculatory potential. But amid all the snake oil, it's worth keeping in mind that the orgasm reflex is part of the autonomic nervous system—it's an involuntary response outside of the control of the mind. The momentary out-of-body sense of “timelessness” that we experience when we've reached the point of no return is intrinsic to the release of sexual tension and part and parcel of the joy of sexual ecstasy; it shouldn't be muddled up with mind control exercises that may, in the end, enable a woman to produce a wee bit of fluid, but do not qualitatively enhance the experience of orgasm, and indeed may ultimately detract from it.

However, the fluid that is reputed to gush when consciously impelled by the bearing down of the pelvic muscles may very well be coming from the bladder and thereby contain urine. Women who train themselves to consciously ejaculate also appear to produce more fluid than women who emit fluid involuntarily, lending further credence to the idea that urine may be contributing to the overall volume of ejaculate. What's interesting as well is that interviews with women who are able to voluntarily ejaculate reveal that the process is independent of sexual arousal and does not necessarily heighten the pleasure of orgasm, whereas women who involuntarily ejaculate are unable to parse the experience of orgasm and ejaculation and often don't even know that they've ejaculated. All in all, it does not appear that ejaculation, voluntary or involuntary, does much to enhance the pleasure of orgasm.

# 13. How Wet Is Wet?

THE VAGINA IS VITAL to the reproductive process—as a birth canal, a receptacle for sperm, and a vehicle for the release of menstrual blood—but not in the production of pleasure.


In a nonaroused state, the vagina is a compressed tube, about three to four inches long, composed of muscle, and lined with mucous membranes not dissimilar to the lining of the mouth. During arousal, a woman's vagina widens and opens in order to accommodate the penis—a few inches in both depth and width— creating what Masters and Johnson referred to as the “ballooning” effect. Meanwhile, the outer third of the vagina begins to narrow and tighten as the clitoral structures that are located there fill with blood; this compression creates a “clitoral cuff” that actually helps stimulate a man to orgasm through the application of pressure and friction against the penis.

A woman's vagina usually begins to lubricate shortly after stimulation—what looks like beads of sweat form all over the vaginal walls; this is sometimes called vaginal sweating. Just below the vaginal opening are the ducts that connect to the vulvovaginal glands, which secrete a few drops of thick fluid that contribute, along with the sweating of the vagina, to the lubrication of the vaginal opening.

As we will discuss in the section on foreplay, lubrication is a big part of the arousal process, but is by no means an unequivocal indicator that a woman's been amply stimulated. __She may be lubricated, but not necessarily aroused. These secretions are part of the vagina's natural way of keeping it free of bacteria that don't belong there. Conversely, a woman may be highly aroused, yet not necessarily well lubricated.__

# 14. Aristotle and the Poetics of Arousal

# 15. A Synopsis of Female Sexual Response

### Act 1 — Foreplay: The Call to Action

In ACT 1. Foreplay galvanizes the mind and body toward sexual response.

* Dozens of chemicals and hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing a woman to become “emotionally stoned,” according to Theresa Crenshaw, M.D., author of The Alchemy of Love and Lust.
* The flow of blood is redirected toward the pelvid area; nerve bivers in the genital area become excited, and rectile tissue begins to engorge.
* Across the body, the skin becomes extra sensitive to touch.
* The breasts swell in size, and stimulation of the nipples initiates the production of oxytocin, a hormone that creates pleasurable sensations throughout the genital area.
* As blood vessels force fluid through the walls of the vagina, the vulvovaginal glands produce a small amount of thick fluid that acts as a lubricant.
* The clitoral head emerges from its hood.

### Act II—Coreplay: Tension and Release
* Muscle tension builds throughout the body; respiration increases, blood pressure goes up, and the heart beats faster.
* The entrance to the vagina narrows while its inner depths widen and increase at least two inches in length.
* The clitoral body (the shaft, legs, and bulb) stiffens, stretches, and elongates.
* The spongy tissue of the clitoral cluster swells and its ridges can be clearly felt protruding from the vaginal ceiling.
* The suspensory ligament tightens and causes the highly sensitized clitoral head to retract beneath its hood, where it will remain until orgasm.
* The round ligament, positioned between the uterus and the inner lips, tugs on both ends, involving the uterus in the process of sexual response and climax

As coreplay continues:

* The skin flushes; breathing deepens.
* The heart rate soars, everything tightens in a final clench.
* Her inner labia change color, darkening with the engorgement of blood.

> During the process of arousal, erectile tissue engorges with blood, causing the clitoral head nearly to double in size.

Finally, all the muscular tension that has been building explodes in orgasm—a series of quick, rhythmic contractions.

* The vagina walls and the pelvic floor muscles contract rhythmically in approximately 0.8-second intervals.
* The sphincter muscles in the rectum also contract spasmodically in sync with genital contractions. In addition, the uterus contracts because of an influx of oxytocin
* These contractions produce waves of pleasure, and with some women the orgasm is accompanied by the ejaculation of a small amount of clear, alkaline fluid.

The number of orgasmic contractions varies, anywhere from three to fifteen on average, although Masters and Johnson observed a woman who experienced a forty-three-second orgasm consisting of more than twenty-five successive contractions. Additionally, it's been observed that pregnant women sometimes experience prolonged orgasms because of the persistent engorgement of their genitals.

> While there's no rule of thumb for the number of orgasmic contractions, women tend to experience six to ten contractions, whereas men generally have four to six. Once again, we are reminded of Masters and Johnson's declaration that a woman has “an infinitely greater capacity for sexual response than a man ever dreamed of.”

### Act III—Moreplay: The Return to Balance

After orgasm is the resolution phase, a return to calm and the prearoused state. Men and women differ strikingly in this phase, with the former losing their erections quickly and entering into what's known as a refractory period, an interval of time that needs to pass before he can get an erection again.

With women, it takes longer for the genitals to return to their normal state, at least five to ten minutes. Women tend not to get sleepy, their genitals don't become hypersensitive (except the clitoral head), and they don't experience a refractory period—with a little stimulation they're ready to begin the process all over again.

The difference between how and men and women experience the resolution phase is what I call the “snuggle gap”: women want more interaction; men want to roll over and go to sleep. While much literature has been devoted to the “insensitivity” of men and the “neediness” of women in this respect, it's far more effective to understand that the snuggle gap is largely the result of biology (men crash quickly after sex, women come down slowly), so don't overanalyze, or get angry and pick a fight; instead, respect each other's differences and compromise: fall asleep while holding her in your arms.

# 16. Scent and Sensibility

All this fuss and hullabaloo over hygiene; and yet, in reality, a woman's genitals are a self-cleaning system—more sanitary than many other parts of the body, including the mouth. One of the reasons a woman is often lubricated, even when she's not aroused, is that these secretions are part of the vagina's natural way of keeping it bacteria-free. As science writer Natalie Angier has written: “The vagina is its own ecosystem, a land of unsung symbiosis and tart vigor. Sure, the traditional concept of a vagina is 'It's a swamp down there!' but tidal pool would be more accurate: aqueous, stable, yet in perpetual flux.”

__At the core of this ecosystem is a sophisticated process of symbiosis, one in which healthy bacteria protect and ward off the unhealthy. It's been said that a woman's genitals are as clean as a fresh carton of yogurt, and this comparison is often made because the kind of bacteria found in yogurt, lactobacilli, are also found in a woman's vaginal secretions. In fact, if symbiosis is compromised and unhealthy, anaerobic bacteria gain an advantage, eating yogurt can often help to stave off infection and restore balance.__

If there is a bad smell in the genital area, the first thing worth paying attention to is personal hygiene. Like men, women sweat down there and, more often than not, showering or bathing, or even engaging in what the French refer to as a “tart-wash” (a quick freshening of the underarms and genital area) can usually help to rid oneself of any unwanted odors.

However, if personal hygiene has been attended to, and an off- putting odor still persists, it's probably time to go to the doctor: she could be suffering from an infection, bacterial vaginosis, in which a lack of lactobacilli creates an imbalance and allows anaerobic bacteria to accumulate. This, according to Natalie Angier, is where the comparison to fish often comes into play, as these microbes produce trimethylamine, the same substance that gives day-old fish its odor.

Gertrude Stein, a cunnilinguist in her own right, may have been mistaken: a rose is a rose is not always a rose. Some women are born with imbalances, and might have a predisposition toward vaginosis and a stronger odor. In addition to eating yogurt, there are also antibiotic treatments that can help restore balance.

Every woman smells and tastes different. Some are sweeter than others, some are a bit more pungent, still others are more neutral and nondescript. Sometimes the differences are subtle, other times they're stark. Nor will the same woman always consistently smell or taste the same. Lots of factors can affect smell and taste, including: diet, vitamin deficiencies, medication, her cycle (some women produce vaginal secretions that contain compounds called aliphaticacid chains, and may cause her scent to vary with the phase of her menstrual cycle), infection, hydration, alcohol, drugs, tobacco. Unprotected sex can also affect a woman's smell, in that sperm is highly alkaline and raises the pH level of the vaginal ecosystem.

> According to science writer Natalie Angier, a woman can contract vaginosis (an infection that affects her scent) from engaging in unprotected sex. As it turns out, sperm is highly alkaline, more than any other body fluid. When introduced during unprotected sex, this causes the overall pH level of the vagina to rise, and briefly allows unhealthy bacteria to gain advantage. Usually the body quickly readjusts to normal levels, especially when the sperm is familiar, as it is when two partners are committed to each other and monogamous. But if a woman has unprotected sex with one or more new partners, the body may not be able to restore balance as quickly as possible as a result of immunological factors.So in some sense, smell may be indicative of promiscuity, and is probably why the Kamasutra describes licentious women as smelling like fish.

# 18. But proceed with caution
If you give or receive cunnilingus casually, in an unsafe, unprotected environment, you are willfully place yourself in a  
high-risk category for the transmission and/or contraction of an STD, including: AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydia, genital warts, and hepatitis. (Men also need to worry about nongonococcal urethritis, whereas women should be more than a little concerned about pelvic inflammatory disease.) Of these diseases, gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, nongonococcal urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by the transmission of bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics if caught early enough; the rest are viral and without cure, although in some cases the symptoms are treatable. These STDs are highly contagious and can be transmitted from vulva to mouth and vice versa.

That's not to say there isn't any risk of contracting or transmitting AIDS via cunnilingus. Vaginal secretions of women who are HIV positive have been found to contain small amounts of HIV (with the amounts rising when she is menstruating), and HIV positive men can also transmit the virus via cuts in the mouth.

It should therefore come as no surprise that the more partners a person has had, the more likely that he or she has engaged with those partners outside of a monogamous relationship, and that his or her partner falls into a similar pattern of promiscuity, thereby greatly increasing the risk of having come into contact with an STD.

As it turns out, promiscuity triggers a domino effect of risky behaviors: “The more partners an individual has, the more likely he or she is to have sex with people who themselves have many partners, the more likely he or she is to have sex with virtual strangers, the more likely she or he is to have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol during some sexual encounters, and while it is more likely that a condom was used, the rate of increased use of a condom does not seem great enough to offset the higher risks of infection.” (Sex in America Survey)

# 19. Eat right

CUNNILINGUS MAY BE a casual activity, but that doesn't mean you should treat it casually. Make sure that it's part of your safe- sex routine. If you're engaging a new partner, communicate openly and candidly. Be prepared to discuss your current sex partners, sexual history, risky behaviors, STD status, recent activities, and your approach to protection. Be aware that some STDs are asymptomatic and may flourish undetected; so if you find yourself caught up in the heat of the moment, think before engaging in unprotected cunnilingus. Regardless of the reward, even the smallest act is not without risk.

# 20. The Cunnilinguist Manifesto

* Respect the female process of arousal
* Postpone gratification in the pursuit of mutual pleasure Know and appreciate the clitoris in all its manifold aspects
* Stimulate the clitoris appropriately through the entire process of sexual response
* Dispense with the conventional wisdom that exalts genital penetration as the apogee of sexual pleasure
* Purge yourself of stereotypes, clichés, and prejudices Be patient, respectful, sensitive, and tender
* Take an approach that is pleasure-oriented, not goal-oriented Approach each act as a unique process of giving and receiving, knowing and learning
* Give of yourself seriously, generously, and wholeheartedly, even if your relationship is casual and impermanent

Easier said than done. Even Karl Marx recognized that in order for words to become actions, the proper preconditions for success must be firmly in place. In the cunnilinguist revolution, we cannot underestimate the insidious forces of fear, shame, and ignorance.

A woman may be deeply conflicted when it comes to receiving cunnilingus and the experience may be fraught with anxiety. Who knows for sure what emotional baggage she may carry? Take nothing for granted. There's an utter nakedness to cunnilingus, a vulnerability that we must respect and honor. She is exposing herself to be seen, smelled, tasted, and observed firsthand; she is permitting the exploration of a part of her body that she herself may find unfamiliar and mysterious. She may think her vulva is ugly, unkempt, unpredictable in its secretions, odoriferous, and strange. She may insist on making love in the dark, literally and figuratively.

As cunnilinguists we need to be committed, steadfast, and confident in our resolve. If she senses that we're the least bit ambivalent, insincere, or impatient, then our efforts will be for naught. Only by inspiring trust will you lull her into a deeper, more instinctive zone of the self, a place where she can shed all inhibition and surrender herself to the soft warm wetness of your tongue.

To that end, the Three Assurances of the cunnilinguist manifesto are as follows:

* Going down on her turns you on; you enjoy it as much as she does.
* There's no rush; she has all the time in the world. You want to savor every moment.
* Her scent is provocative, her taste powerful: it all emanates from the same beautiful essence.

# 21. A Note on the Play Process

Additionally, the relegation of cunnilingus to foreplay reinforces the false idea that the tongue is best applied during the early stages of sexual response, when in fact the opposite is true: because of the heightened sensitivity of the clitoris, direct stimulation is best approached slowly and gradually, and is ideally preceded by a variety of erotic activates.

In short, cunnilingus is not foreplay, it’s coreplay, the best approach for consistently applying various methods of clitoral stimulation; and one that, like genital penetration, requires an appropriate prologue of erotic activity.

# 22. Foreplay: A Lexicon of Relevant Terms

__Avoid__: __During foreplay avoid direct contact with her genitals for a minimum of ten to fifteen minutes. Stimulate other parts of her body; let the oxytocin wash over her and pervade her bloodstream. Save the genital kiss for last, as the first kiss upon the vulva is the threshold between foreplay and coreplay.__

__Body, hers__: Keep in mind that skin is our largest sexual organ, and the entire body, from head to toe, is one big erogenous zone. This is especially true of women, as the female body is generally smaller than the male and the same numbers of nerves are consequently dispersed across a smaller surface area; hence the number of sensitive receptors is proportionally larger on the female body. Second, the female skin is generally thinner and less hairy than the male, so sensations are more clearly felt. Sex researchers have observed that some women can reach orgasm by simply having their eyebrows stroked or their earlobes kissed. As Voltaire wrote, “Love is a canvas furnished by Nature and embroidered by imagination.”

__Breasts__: __While there is indeed a biological basis for the pleasure connection between breasts and vulva in the form of oxytocin—a chemical that heightens our sensitivity to touch and is released in her genital area when the breasts are stimulated—numerous studies reveal that breast contact stimulates men way more than it does women. In a Kinsey study of female sexual response, only 11 percent of the eight thousand women surveyed said that they stroked their breasts during masturbation (compared to 84 percent who stroked their clitoris or labia minora). So it stands to reason that when it comes to her breasts, a significant component of her pleasure is the enjoyment of yours.__ Every woman is different regarding the breast sensitivity, so err on the side of tenderness and look for feedback. As one of this author's interviewees put it, “Savor, don't suckle.”

Breathing, hers: Most men think of vaginal wetness as the most reliable indicator of a woman's level of arousal; and while there is in deed a strong correlation between lubrication and sexual response, she may or may not be wet for reasons that have nothing to do with her level of sexual excitement. __Breathing, on the other hand, is an 1 often-neglected indicator. As she gets more aroused, look for the commensurate changes in her breathing, and tightening of the abdominal muscles.__

Candles: __Men and women differ when it comes to their attitudes about doing it with the lights on. Like Hemingway, men often enjoy “a clean, well-lighted place” in which to practice and observe their craft, whereas women seem to prefer the cover of dark. Compromise with candlelight.__

Fantasies: So potent is the power of the imagination that some women are actually able to fantasize themselves to orgasm, without any physical stimulation at all. Studies reveal that men and women fantasize differently. In general, women tend to fantasize in ways that are more situational and narrative, whereas men's fantasies tend to focus on specific physical and graphical elements of sexual encounters.In terms of subject matter, there is overlap between men and women, with common fantasies including: multiple partners, soft bondage, anal play, cheating, watching others voyeuristically, and having sex in public places.

__Fellatio__: One of her greatest sources of pleasure will be to pleasure you, and there's no better way for her to do so than with some generous oral attention. Just don't get too carried away. Numerous surveys note that men enjoy fellatio as much as, if not more than, intercourse, and that it's the easiest way for a woman to stimulate a man to orgasm. Receiving head is not permission to climax. As Dr. Comfort wrote in The New Joy of Sex, “A few men can't take even the shortest genital kiss before ejaculating.” So if fellatio is something you love and must have, then go for a “light snack” during foreplay and put in your request for prolonged attention after coreplay.

Kissing: As Shelley wrote, “Soul meets soul on lovers' lips.” A kiss is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed. A kiss is a unique and versatile expression of the soul. A kiss can be playful, patient, and coy; or ravenous, forceful, and violent. __According to the teachings of Tantra, a woman's upper lip is considered one of the most erogenous areas on her body because of a special nerve that connects it to the clitoris, and is said to channel erotic energy.__ Like language itself, there is virtually no emotion that cannot be expressed with a kiss. Cunnilingus is simply the art of extending a kiss into a complete act of lovemaking.

__Lubricant, artificial__: There's an old Malagasy proverb, “Let your love be like the misty rain, coming softly, hut flooding the river.” But if your partner doesn't lubricate consistently, easily, or at all, don't take it personally.n terms of cunnilingus, artificial lubricant is neither as important nor as indispensable as it is during genital intercourse. As Dr. Comfort noted in The New Joy of Sex, “The best sexual lubricant is saliva” and it's usually in ample supply during cunnilingus. But even he mouth grows dry at times, so it never hurts to have some lubricant close at hand. __In selecting a lubricant, read the ingredients carefully and stay away from those that are oil-based and contain chemicals such nonoxynol-9, a commonly used spermicidal that tastes awful, and can burn and lead to infection. Also, stay away from jellies, such as K-Y, that are greasy and heavy. Best to choose a water-based product that has few ingredients. Astroglide is a common favorite, and has arned the reputation of its tagline, “second only to nature.”__ There's no shortage of choices, so enjoy the process of selection.

Massage, foot: __One of the most underestimated and underutilized forms of erotic stimulation, a good solid foot massage floods the bloodstream with endorphins and energizes the entire body. No need to worry about not being a professional masseur, just maintain persistent contact between hand and foot, massaging one foot at a time with both hands. Work the whole foot: the sole, ball, ankle, and toe joints before going to the other one. Feel free to kiss her toes. Some women won't be able to stand it, while others will experience the heights of pleasure.__

Masturbation: Sex researchers Masters and Johnson gathered much of their information about female sexual response by watching women masturbate. __Take note: they consistently observed that women focused their manual stimulation on the clitoral head, as well as the shaft, mons pubis, and inner and outer labia. Because of the heightened sensitivity of the head, most women stimulated it at the peak of arousal, and avoided direct contact immediately subsequent to orgasm. Dr. Kinsey found that 95 percent of the women he studied climaxed far more often through masturbation than during genital penetration. This observation was corroborated by Masters and Johnson, who found that over 90 percent of women were able to experience an orgasm through masturbation.__

Masturbation, shared: Not necessarily for her eves only, but an opportunity to observe a woman's unique way of consistently bringing herself to climax—something clearly worth studying. __If she's never masturbated in front of you, create an environment of intimacy and trust. Most important, let her know that it's something you want her to do because it turns you on and because you want to learn more about how to please her.__

Orgasms, multiple: Oftentimes a woman will experience an orgasm during foreplay, particularly if ample stimulation has been effectively applied. While all women have the innate biological capacity for multiple orgasms, not all have experienced them and many might be unaware of their inherent potential. __If she climaxes during foreplay, transition for a few minutes into a milder form of stimulation such as kissing and hugging before moving into core- play. This shift in activity is particularly essential if her orgasm was the result of manual stimulation of the clitoris, as the clitoral head is particularly sensitive to touch following orgasm. Let her cool down, but keep her warm and sexualized by focusing your attention on other parts of her body. After this brief interval, you will be able to return to direct stimulation of her vulva and get ready for her next orgasm.__

__Penetration: If cunnilingus is coreplay, then it's possible to think of genital penetration as an aspect of part of foreplay. In the standard missionary position—you on top, her beneath you—use the tip of your penis to barely penetrate her vaginal entrance. Let your penis rest just inside her. (If you're uncomfortable in the missionary position, then simply kneel or sit in front of her vulva.) Linger. Loiter. Meander. Stay close to the entrance. Press your thumb against her clitoral head and gently flick it from side to side as you penetrate her with short shallow thrusts. Or press the shaft of your penis against her clitoris and then gently thrust between the folds of her labia without ever entering her. Or she can perform Kegels (the squeezing of her pelvic muscles) while you, ever so slowly, penetrate her. Really take the time to feel her pelvic muscles contract against your penis as you slowly withdraw.__

Ties: The kind that bind. Restraining a lover during sexual activity is a popular fantasy, and one that, unlike some others, is easily realized, and erotically rewarding. When approached safely as a lighthearted, playful activity, restraint is a fun, guilt-free way of acting out dominance roles and expressing healthy sexual aggression. It stimulates her body by allowing her to flex her muscles more intensely than when unrestrained; it also stimulates her mind by allowing her to surrender to pleasure and act out in ways that might normally make her feel awkward or shy. It also encourages you to take your time and lavish her with attention as she submits to your teasing. From constraint comes creativity. If you're new to this topic, err on the side of caution and peruse the pointers in the Appendix before proceeding.
