A __demand-side platform (DSP)__ is a system that allows buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple __ad exchange__ and __data exchange__ accounts through one interface. Real-time bidding for displaying online advertising takes place within the ad exchanges, and by utilizing a DSP, marketers can manage their bids for the banners and the pricing for the data that they are layering on to target their audiences. Much like Paid Search, using DSPs allows users to optimize based on set Key Performance Indicators such as __effective Cost per Click (eCPC)__, and __effective Cost per Action (eCPA)__.

DSPs are unique because they incorporate many of the facets previously offered by advertising networks, such as wide access to inventory and vertical and lateral targeting, with the ability to serve ads, real-time bid on ads, track the ads, and optimize. This is all kept within one interface which creates a unique opportunity for advertisers to truly control and maximize the impact of their ads. The sophistication of the level of detail that can be tracked by DSPs is increasing, including frequency information, multiple forms of rich media ads, and some video metrics. Many third parties are integrating with DSPs to provide better tracking.

DSPs are commonly used for __retargeting__, as it is able to see a large volume of inventory in order to recognize an ad call with a user that an advertiser is trying to reach. The percentage of bids that are won over the bids that were submitted is called a win rate.

In a huge digital ecosystem called RTB (real-time bidding), programmatic instantaneous auction where ad inventory is bought and sold on a “per impression basis”, there are a number of key players – “the buyer side” (advertiser) and “the seller side” (publisher). What do they buy or sell? Digital space of course!

It would be ridiculous to assume that buyers and publishers do everything manually or negotiate deals face-to-face like they would do 50 years ago. Right now, the process if fully automated and that is where DSP and SSP technology comes into use.

Demand-Side Platforms represent the interests of buyers and Supply-Side Platforms represent the interests of publishers. DSP is so to say, a flip side of SSP, but they both interplay and empower instant delivery of advertising to targeted users.

Making long story short…DSP in a nutshell

So what is DSP? Demand-Side Platforms is a technology system that enables buyers purchasing auction-based digital ad inventory, managing multiple ad exchanges and data exchanges through a single user interface. DSP assures more efficient buying and selling by reduced costs and increased transparency.

DSP introduces advanced targeting tools, providing options to target contextually, behaviorally, geographically, and even option to retarget later. The biggest advantage of DSPs is their ability to make automated decisions on how much to bid on each specific ad impression in real time, based on the targeting requirement of the advertiser. Therefore, advertisers can generate the most value and increase return on investments (ROI).

Where do I get this “DSP”?

DSPs are could be managed by in-house marketing departments or alternatively, by programmatic companies that specialize in real-time advertising. Key DSP players guarantee buyers reaching billions daily impressions, worth to mention: DoubleClick Bid Manager, BrightRoll DSP, Mediamath etc. One of the fastest growing players in the industry - SmartyAds - provides personalized DSP with customized services, fully programmable. Therefore, you can see that all companies provide “DSP platforms” but not all of them share exact the same features, so choose smart!
