* I think the most important question people should ask about themselves is "Who am I and what kind of life do I want to live?". In short, "find your identity". Identity is the conglomerate of personality, desire, principles, belief, personal standards, etc. It defines who we are, decides what we want and what kind of life we want to live. If we really know our identities, most our frustrations, depressions, mistakes, confusions can be avoided, and even thoses misfortune will seem comparatively insignificant. The reason is simple, the answers to our questions are mostly reside in our mind, not in outside world.
