# Introduction : Movemet

Until you learn to trust your own actions and learn to pursue women with your own unique style and personality, you have learned absolutely nothing.

And I’ll give you a free preview: it has little to nothing to do with what you’re saying. It has everything to do with body, expression, emotion, and movement.

Emerson once wrote, “What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.” Seduction is the interplay of emotions. Your movement, or lack of movement, reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side effect. Sex is the side effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.

# Chapter 1  Non-Neediness

__A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The less needy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average. The needier he is, the less attractive he will be to women on average.__

Neediness is when a man places a higher priority on others’ perceptions of him than his perception of himself. A needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by impressing and winning approval from others. Non-neediness is when a man places a higher priority on his own perception of himself than the perceptions of others. A non-needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by embodying his own values and desires.

Neediness, therefore, infiltrates all behaviors because it is what inspires and instigates all behaviors. A lack of neediness also infiltrates all behaviors for the same reason. Because it underlies all of your actions and words, to be non-needy is to be more attractive, in every way. It defines and resonates in everything you say and do, the way you stand, the way you smile, the jokes you tell, the people you associate with, the car you drive, the wine you drink, the jacket you wear.

When people say vague things like, “I like the way he carries himself,” or “you just need to believe in yourself,” or, “he just has ‘it’, whatever ‘it’ is,” they are referring to a man’s lack of neediness. It exudes from him in everything he does. __Paradoxically, a man’s lack of need for attention and admiration is itself a magnet for attention and admiration. A man’s comfort and acceptance of the possibility that some people will not like him makes people like him even more. A man’s respect for differing opinions makes those around him want to agree with him more.__

A needy man is constantly investing in the perceptions others have in him. He is being extra nice and “friendly when he doesn’t want to be because he believes he must do this to be liked and loved. He is buying a fancy watch and season tickets to the local sports team so that he will be admired and loved. He is coming up with fake compliments or pretending to be a bad ass because he thinks it will get him attention and love.

A non-needy man may still do these behaviors — he may still buy the season tickets or make the jokes. But his intentions are different. Whereas a needy man says and does these things for approval, the non-needy man does them simply for the pleasure of doing. The needy man tries to control what others think and feel more than what he thinks and feels himself. The non-needy man is more concerned with controlling his own thoughts and feelings rather than the thoughts and feelings of others. A needy man will be more invested in the woman he is with than in himself – he will be more concerned about her opinion, about him, about the weather, about everything other than what he actually thinks and feels. A non-needy man will be more invested in himself than the woman he’s with.

By investment, I mean the degree to which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you.

That may sound cold, un-PC, and yes, it made me squirm a little bit when I first realized it. But it’s true.
Think about it, for the majority of human history, men had few material possessions by which women would judge their status. Back in the caveman days, there were no outdoor pools and tax returns. They didn’t have brand name sandals and expensive haircuts. At most, one man had a little bit more meat to share than the next guy.

Therefore, for the majority of human history, women watched men’s behavior. Ask yourself what kind of behavior would indicate to a woman that a “man is high status and fit to raise her children? These are the men who would be sexually selected over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

Would it be a man who defers to all of the other men around him, who begs the women to be with him, who can’t stand up for himself and whose emotions are dictated by those around him? Or would it be the man who controls his own destiny, is unfazed by the threats others may pose to him and who shrugs it off if he pursues a woman and she has no interest in him?
The second man indicates a man of status. If you’re at the top of the food chain, you have no reason to be inhibited or to defer to others (unless you want to). If you’re at the bottom of the food chain, your entire life will revolve around deferring to others.

The high-status man displays non-neediness. The low-status man displays neediness.

Neediness is not consciously calculated by women or people in general. I guarantee you will not see women walking around with neediness scorecards.

Neediness is a feeling. It’s intuited by women. It’s instinctual. It’s the gag reflex she has when a guy calls her twelve too many times. It’s the distaste she has when he seems to laugh a little too hard at her jokes. It’s the annoyance she has when he seems to make every decision for her rather than letting her fend for herself.

Women unconsciously detect neediness by sensing the intentions behind a man’s behavior and words. It’s why women can often become turned off at the most innocuous moment or by the most unimportant statement. Consciously, the action or statement may seem harmless, but unconsciously, it conveyed everything they need to know about your status and that is this: you base your actions on a constant need for approval.

As you are probably aware, women can be needy as well. And although neediness is a turn-off for most men, it’s not the complete deal breaker that it is for women.

To most women, a man with no neediness is like a woman with perfect tits and a gorgeously sculpted ass. To a woman, a man with a lot of neediness is like having the worst breath and missing teeth.

It’s important to note that non-neediness doesn’t mean you should only care about yourself. This is narcissism, and although it might get you laid, it is not attractive and will result in dysfunctional relationships.

When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her, you should be invested in her. That’s the whole fun of it! That’s the reason we have relationships in the first place, to be touched and moved by others. The important point here is how we prioritize other people’s perceptions versus our own. Which is more important? Hers or yours?

Highly needy men will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with highly needy women. The highly needy man is constantly working to earn a woman’s approval, and a highly needy woman is constantly in need of a man’s approval. So the two conspire together, usually with one creating drama/emotional meltdowns and the other one endlessly fixing it. This relationship is toxic and can harm each person’s self-worth.

Narcissistic men, or men who only care about themselves, will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with narcissistic and shallow women. Both the narcissistic man and woman will view each other merely as ornaments to adorn their self-absorbed lives. These relationships also are toxic. And these relationships also often end poorly.

Now all this stuff sounds nice. But let’s put this into concrete, real-world terms. Here are a couple examples.

### The Seduction Process

Biologically, women have a lot more to lose than men when it comes to sex. As a result, they’ve had incentives to (usually) be pickier in choosing their sexual partners. Men, on the other hand, have historically had fewer repercussions for promiscuity and, from a biological point of view, even gain some advantages by being promiscuous.

Whether it’s biological or cultural or some mixture of both, the fact is that female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets. Women have evolved a sexuality that is more psychological than physical, and that psychological need is rooted in the need for security and connection.

This is why status is based on behavior and not simply assets. A man who is rich in assets has greater potential to make a woman feel secure and comfortable, but if his behavior implies that he won’t, then she won’t be attracted to him. A physically fit man will imply greater fitness for her children, but again, if his behavior implies he will be incapable or incompetent in raising them, then she will not be attracted to him.

Because men value sex more than women at the beginning of a relationship, and sexual opportunities are scarcer for men than women, women tend to be less invested and more confident early in on the interaction. When a man approaches her and induces her to become as invested in him as he is in her, this is the process of seduction. Sex occurs as a natural side effect of this process.

__“Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in her.”__

There are two ways for seduction to happen: 1) a man creates the perception that he is far less invested in her than he actually is (neediness disguised as non-neediness), and 2) a man actually is less invested in her (genuine non-neediness).
The first method (a man giving false impressions) occurs through what I call “performance.” The vast majority of the dating advice out there for men (and women) is performance-based advice — say this, act like this, don’t call her back right away, pretend you don’t like her, make these jokes, etc.

The second method (a man demonstrating less investment) is a passive process that he does within himself and that permeates every aspect of his behavior over the long-term. There’s nothing to learn or memorize. There is nothing to practice or study. It only requires one to move his yardstick for success from external goals (more dates, more sex) to internal goals (better relationships, more emo“tional fulfillment, overall happiness). This book will lay out how this internal process occurs and how to achieve it in yourself.

Performance-based dating advice technically “works.” It’s just not fulfilling. You’re not actually solving the problem (your neediness); you're just covering it up. A man who becomes successful through a series of performance-based behaviors may have sex, but he is setting himself up for terrible and unfulfilling relationships with other needy women.”

Learning techniques and pick up lines without doing genuine, identity-level work in order to permanently decrease your neediness ends up only being a band-aid solution. It provides a short, temporary relief from an otherwise permanent problem. It causes more stress. And it ultimately makes us feel worse about ourselves.

Overcoming neediness is not about learning what to say or new things to do. Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect. It's as simple as just changing your mind about women.

Take a moment to consider: 

* That before meeting a woman, instead of worrying whether or not she will like you, you could wonder if you will like her.  
* That instead of feeling the need to impress her, you could wonder if she impresses you.  
* That instead of sitting there silently wondering what to say next to make her like you, you could sit there silently wondering what she will say to make you like her.  
*That instead of waiting around for her to call, you could find something else to do while she waits for your call.  
*That instead of worrying if you’re tall enough or good-looking enough or skinny enough, you could decide whether they’re too superficial to recognize your great qualities.  
* That instead of trying to come up with the perfect date, you could decide that a woman who really likes you for you doesn’t need a perfect date.   
* That instead of looking for a conversation she’ll enjoy, you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest.   
* That instead of looking for her approval, you could decide whether or not to give yours.  
* That instead of getting upset about why she doesn’t want to be with you, you could decide that it means you probably wouldn’t want to be with her.  
* This may all sound a bit selfish. But, in fact, it’s called having strong boundaries and high self-esteem. It’s called being non-needy and an attractive man. 
* Only making time for people who make time for you. Only being interested in dating people who are interested in dating you. Worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy. Looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs. Changing yourself to become who you want to be, not what you think women want you to be.

Because, ironically, that is what women want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be.  

Women are attracted to a man they can respect, to a man they can trust. If you’re constantly looking for approval for what to say and how to feel, how could anyone respect or trust you?  

You are what attracts (or repels) others — not the words, not the strategies. If you aren’t happy with the results you get, then it’s time to improve you.

I don’t care how hot she is. Is she good enough for you? Does she have integrity? Standards? Is she smart, personable, caring? Are you ready to leave on a dime if she offends you or breaks your trust?

If not, that’s probably why you’re not with her in first place.

The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Work on yourself. Conquer your anxieties. 

Resolve your shame. Take care of yourself and those who are important to you.

Love yourself. Otherwise no, one else will.

### Narcissism and Overcompensation

When a man has spent his entire life needy and highly invested, doing the legitimate work to transform himself into a confident, attractive man is not easy.

To become non-needy, a man must develop self-respect, a healthy sense of boundaries, social competence, and healthy life habits. It’s often a painful long-term process that entails quite a bit of introspection, questioning, doubt, anger, frustration, lifestyle changes, and so on.

But there is a shortcut. And that shortcut is to objectify women, to treat them as objects or trophies to be accumulated or paraded around for others.

As I said earlier, some men try to fake non-neediness through performance. We’ve already seen how this ultimately fails in the long run.

But other men overcompensate. It’s so hard for them to let go of what others think of them and to stand up for themselves. So they go the complete opposite direction and decide to only care about themselves. They become narcissistic and self-serving, they view their relationships as vehicles to get specific benefits and are unconcerned with the needs of the person they’re with.

Needy men only know how to care about what others want, even if it harms themselves. Non-needy men look for that intersection where they can get both their own needs and their partner’s needs met. Narcissistic men overcompensate and decide to only pursue getting their own needs met.

Narcissistic men usually do this by conjuring up all sorts of false beliefs about the inferiority or difference of women — how women are incapable of rationality, how they’re “hypergamous,” how they manipulate men, how women are destined to be dominated and controlled.

It’s all bullshit, but these men use it as a justification for their overcompensation to put them at ease in their own self-absorption.

Men who go narcissistic act like they’re more important than anybody else. They are aggressive, insensitive, and demanding. They are self-serving and don’t handle rejection or loss well. Some of these men even end up becoming abusive.

But the narcissist’s façade is weak and transparent. The truth is that the man’s narcissism is wielded as a sort of shield to protect the sensitive neediness underneath. See, narcissistic men are still desperate for the approval of others. They’ve just taken a counterintuitive route to getting it: their own self-aggrandizement. Whereas a needy man will play at being meek and unimportant in order to get approval from others, the narcissist proclaims his own greatness to get approval from others.

When a woman becomes merely another conquest, a number, something to treat like a trophy or a toy, it can be extremely easy to assert yourself around them, to prioritize your own values and beliefs over theirs, to risk rejection around them, and to dominate any perspective they might have — all attractive confident traits, merely expressed in horrible ways.

Narcissism is also taught to men as a form of dating advice. Much of the dating advice out there advises men to be selfish, to be “alpha,” to be dominant and aggressive and to ignore women’s objections or rejections, to pursue what you want no matter what and take it through pure persistence and aggression. It will justify this advice with all sorts of explanations that women don’t actually know what they want, that they’re just “testing” you, that they actually want it but they can’t say it, and so on.

Narcissism is also often promoted to men by other men growing up, especially in highly “macho” cultures (Latin America, the Middle East, East Asian, etc.). Men are often raised by other narcissistic men who only found their way through relationships through self-aggrandizement and selfishness, and so they seek to pass these traits onto their sons.

Narcissism in a relationship is built on the idea of always being dominant or in control. It is a nebulous mixture of selfishness, assertiveness, and domination that is achieved not through investing more in oneself, but by minimizing the importance of others.

This strategy is ultimately self-sabotaging then. Narcissistic men see seduction and relationships as another competition to be dominated and won, not as a collaboration to be enjoyed. If the goal is to cultivate highly enriching relationships that add to one’s life, then minimizing the importance of those around you in order to attract them to you makes the resulting relationships unfulfilling and superficial.

Narcissistic men end up with narcissistic and/or highly needy women. Narcissistic women will use the narcissistic man to aggrandize themselves, to put themselves up and fulfill their own egotistical goals. Needy women will tolerate a narcissistic man’s poor treatment of them because the needy woman is constantly in search of a feeling of greatness herself.

And the sad thing is, it works — not on all women, not even on most women, but it will work on women who have no confidence, who expect to be treated like shit, and who treat men like shit in return. Women with any self-worth will pass up on a narcissistic man in a heartbeat. She sees right through his macho veneer. But low self-esteem women, particularly women with truckloads of emotional problems or a history of abuse, will gladly throw themselves onto the narcissistic man and bring him down with them.

So yeah, being narcissistic and overcompensating works. But it leads to unpleasant, shallow, and superficial interactions, constant headaches dealing with women who you don’t actually even really like and who probably don’t even actually like you, women regretting having sex with you, and emotionally unstable girls who bother you constantly. It’s like swimming in the shallow end of the pool — yeah, you’re swimming, but it’s not nearly as rewarding as the deep end, and there’s piss everywhere.

Narcissism comes in many varieties but usually boils down to this: focusing on your own wants and desires to the point of imposing them onto others. Exaggerate your dominance and boast of your strength. Accept no wrongdoing. Admit no faults. Blame others for your problems. Go out of your way to make others feel smaller so that you appear bigger.

The problem with narcissism is that it defines itself by getting what it wants from others. A man who is narcissistic only feels non-needy if he’s dominating somebody else and if someone else is giving him what he wants. And in that subtle way, he is therefore more invested in others than he is in himself. He is therefore still needy and unattractive.

To give an example, if a non-needy man meets a woman who rejects him or is not interested in him, he will assume that is was either an incompatibility or that it was just not the right situation. Either way, he will see it as the right thing to have happened. His life will go on.

But when a narcissistic man is rejected, he becomes angry and hurt. He blames the woman for not seeing his greatness. He calls her stupid or selfish or shallow because she’s not willing to give him what he – a random guy talking to her – wants.

It’s just another form of performance — he acts as if he’s in control, but his desperation to be in control is due to insecurity. A non-needy man doesn’t try to control what women feel about him. Rather he tries to control what he feels about certain women. He understands that the world isn’t about him and that all he can control is himself and his own actions. He’s not bothered when things don’t go his way or when people don’t recognize him as being amazing because he already feels amazing himself. He doesn’t need their approval and their disapproval doesn’t faze him from his mission.

Narcissistic men are often serial players, guys who obsessively seek out casual sex and not only regard the women they sleep with poorly, but treat them poorly as well.

I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It’s a reflection of your neediness. Non-needy people don’t date needy people and vice-versa. They can’t because there’s no attraction to begin with.

If all of the women you attract are needy and emotionally helpless, what does that say about you?

The key to non-neediness is to have both: respect for both oneself and for women.

__The only permanent way to attract and date more women and more attractive women is to become more attractive yourself. And the way a man becomes more attractive himself is by investing in himself, in becoming less needy.__

Permanent change to one’s investment and neediness in one’s relationships with women is hard and is a process that encompasses all facets of one’s life. But it’s a worthwhile journey. As a man, it may be the most worthwhile journey.

And the key to it is probably something you wouldn’t expect. In fact, it’s something that most men turn their nose up at when they hear it. The key is vulnerability.

## Chapter 2 Power in Vulnerability

When most men hear the word “vulnerability,” their immediate reaction is to associate it with weakness. In general, men are raised to withhold their emotions, to not show weakness, and to ignore any hint of introspection. On top of that, most of the popular dating advice out there encourages guys to be aloof, standoffish, judgmental, and at times, scathing towards women.

For instance, making yourself vulnerable doesn’t just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don’t know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. All of these things require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way. You’re making yourself vulnerable when you do them.

In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. It’s courageous, even. A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” He’s saying he is non-needy and high status.

Most people think of a man who’s vulnerable as a man who cowers in the corner and begs others to accept him or not hurt him. This is not vulnerability; this is surrender. It’s weakness.

Think of it this way, there are two men. One stands tall, looks straight ahead. Looks people in the eye when he speaks to them. Says what he thinks and is comfortable if some people disagree with him. When he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off and apologizes if necessary. When he sucks at something, he admits it. He’s unafraid to express his emotions, even if that means he gets rejected because of them sometimes. He has no problem moving on to people who don’t reject him, but instead like him for who he is.

The second man hunches over, his eyes dart around and he is unable to look someone in the eye without getting uncomfortable. He puts on a cool persona that is always aloof. He performs. He avoids saying things that may upset others, and sometimes even lies to avoid conflict. He’s always trying to impress people. When he makes a mistake, he tries to blame others or pretend like it didn’t happen. He hides his emotions and will smile and tell everyone he’s fine even when he’s not. He’s scared to death of rejection. And when he is rejected, it sends him reeling, angry, and desperate to find a way to win back the affection of the person who doesn’t like him.

Which one of these two men is more powerful? Which one is more vulnerable? Which one is more comfortable with himself? Which one do you think women would be more attracted to?

From an evolutionary perspective, vulnerability makes perfect sense as an indicator to women of male status and fitness. Let’s say there’s a tribe of 20 men, all hunter-gatherers, all men with more or less equal possessions (or lack thereof).

Some of the men in the tribe are constantly reactive to what the other men tell them. They don’t admit faults. They change their behavior and what they say to win the approval of the other men. When something doesn’t go their way, they look to blame someone else. What would this say about their status in their tribe? If they’re basing all of their behavior on the approval of the other men and are constantly covering up their weaknesses, it says that they’re low status, not trustworthy, unconfident, and probably not going to be a dependable father.

Now imagine other men in the same tribe who are unfazed by the neediness or temper tantrums of the other men around them. They focus purely on the task at hand and don’t change their behavior based on what others think of them. When challenged, they stand up for themselves, but when they’re wrong, they also admit their fault since they see no reason to hide their weakness. They have a sense of honor. They don’t react to any of the other men around them; rather, the other men react to them.

This behavior implies high status, a man who is dependable, comfortable in his strengths and weaknesses, a man who can be counted on and who is likely to rise through the ranks and provide for his offspring.

He’s likely to succeed and likely to be a dependable father. It’s likely that women have been naturally selected to choose high-status men based on their non-neediness first, and then their looks and accomplishments second, since looks and accomplishments tend to be reflections of non-needy behavior, not the other way around. This non-needy behavior indicates a man who is comfortable with vulnerability, who isn’t afraid to express who he is, warts and all, to the world. This plays out in multiple arenas — in the life decisions he makes, the extent of his courage and the way he communicates to others.

Chances are, if you’re reading this and are bad with women, then you’re bad with women because you don’t express your true feelings and intentions very well. Perhaps you’re afraid to introduce yourself to women you find attractive or to ask them out on a date. Perhaps you consistently fall into boring conversation topics because they’re “safe” and shallow and you don’t have to risk offending or inciting any one with them. Perhaps you don’t assert yourself and your desires enough. Perhaps you hide from your own sexuality and become scared or nervous when people expose theirs. Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint the people around you. Dressing extremely well makes you feel uncomfortable, smiling at strangers makes you feel creepy, and the idea of hitting on a woman openly scares you because of the possibility of rejection.

All of these are symptoms of a root problem: an inability to be vulnerable.

Many men, like you, and like me, were raised in such a way as to not express our emotions freely. For whatever reason — maybe our home situation, maybe childhood trauma, maybe our parents didn’t express their emotions either — we’ve grown up with deeply embedded habits designed to keep us stifled and bottled up. Don’t be controversial. Don’t be unique. Don’t do anything “crazy” or “stupid” or “selfish.”

Connecting with women in this way, by being vulnerable — as opposed to performance or narcissism — will result in some of the best interactions and relationships of your life. Vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person. As psychologist Robert Glover once said, “Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.

Show your rough edges. Stop trying to be perfect. Expose yourself and share yourself without inhibition. Take the rejections and lumps and move on because you’re a bigger and stronger man. And when you find a woman who loves who you are (and you will), revel in her affection.

But opening yourself up to vulnerability, training yourself to become comfortable with your emotions, with your faults, and with expressing yourself without inhibitions doesn’t happen overnight. This entire book can be viewed as a how-to guide for vulnerability. But it’s a process, and at times, a grueling one.

### The Pain Period

Maybe you’ve already been through this. Maybe you’ve already spent months or years avoiding taking action because you’re afraid of the consequences. Maybe you’ve put off that career change, that wardrobe upgrade, joining that dating site. Maybe you’ve missed opportunities with women who liked you because you were too afraid to make a move. Maybe you convinced yourself that you needed to “know how” first. Maybe you convinced yourself that you needed to see someone else do it first.
These are all forms of avoidance. And they all come from a deep-seated neediness, and that neediness can only be cured through making yourself more vulnerable. And at first, that vulnerability is going to hurt.

You can’t skip it. The only way out of it is through it.

We all have weaknesses, embarrassments, and vulnerabilities. A needy man is terrified to show them because he cares more about what others feel about him than what he feels about himself. A non-needy man is comfortable showing his flaws because he’s more comfortable with how he feels about himself than how others feel about him.

Sharing yourself openly with others forces that transition between the two: from needy and afraid of what others think, to non-needy and comfortable in how you feel about yourself. __The reason is because sharing these truths about yourself forces you to own them and accept them, and also demonstrates that feeling embarrassed or ashamed is just that, just another feeling, another part of your humanity, not the end of the world.__

The real question is, do you have to work through this emotional baggage and neediness with the women you’re dating? Not necessarily. You can work through them by sharing them with friends, family members, or a therapist. But there are some issues that can only be dealt with by women you’re seeing: particularly intimacy and sexual issues.

But slowly, you will chisel away at yourself. You’ll humble yourself, expose yourself, and then learn that it’s OK. It’s OK to be rejected. It’s OK to make mistakes. It’s OK to say something stupid. Don’t give up. Women will not dislike you for your rejections and mistakes or saying something stupid.

They’ll like you for your ability to be OK with being rejected, to make mistakes, and to say something stupid. The man who always has the perfect line to say to her is a man she will not trust because he shows no vulnerability and his words are inauthentic and, therefore, needy.

The man who has some good lines and some bad lines and is able to admit the latter and laugh at the former, this is a man she will trust and a man she will open herself up to, both emotionally and physically. Become comfortable with being imperfect. It’s your rough edges she’ll be attracted to.

__Ultimately, what women want — what we all really want — is a strong, independent, non-needy partner who fulfills us, who we can share ourselves with and receive them in return.__

Stop looking at communication as the surface information and instead, pay attention to the emotions and motivations behind everything that you do and say. That's where all of the meaning is.

I’ll say this again because this often gets lost: vulnerability is not a technique or tactic. It is a way of being. It’s not something you learn, it’s a mindset you practice.

Here’s a piece of advice: if you ever find yourself thinking, “That didn’t work,” or “This doesn’t work,” then you are performing and you are needy. Point blank. Period.

The whole idea of something “working” on women, is itself a form of neediness. Because a sexual connection is not something you achieve. It’s not a level in a video game that you beat. It’s not something you can strategize. It’s either there or it’s not.

When women emotionally connect with you and your desire for them, it’s not what you’re saying or the words you’re choosing, it’s the emotion behind those words. If the emotion behind your words is needy and self-serving, then she will become turned off no matter what you say, even if you’re telling her the most personal or heartfelt story. If the emotion behind your words is genuine and vulnerable, then it will turn her on, even if you’re talking about your grocery list or how you named your dog. Yes, you can fake this stuff in the short-term if you become a good actor. But obviously, don’t do that. We’re not in this for short-term fixes, remember?

So the catch is that your statements must be authentic. Your statements towards women must be unconditional, otherwise it’s not really being vulnerable. If you tell a woman that she’s beautiful only because you think it’ll give you a better chance of sleeping with her, then amazingly, she will not be very flattered. Try it. It’s true. Give women false compliments and see how they respond. They won’t respond very well.

But communicate with honest appreciation and you’ll be amazed how she lights up in front of you.

So the catch is that everything you say must be as authentic as possible. There’s no shortcut. There are no tricks. You say it because you mean it and mean it because you say it. The more nervous it makes you, the better, because it means you’re being authentic and making yourself vulnerable.

How attractive you are is based on your lack of neediness. Your non-neediness is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others.

## Chapter 3 “The Gift of Truth”

But what I learned is that regardless of what you say to a woman, the intention and implications of why you are saying it are far more powerful than the words themselves.

You can say the lamest and grossest (or funniest, depending on your perspective) thing to women, and if the sub-communication is, “I really don’t care if you laugh or run away horrified, but here’s who I am, take it or leave it,” this sub-communicates a rock-bottom level of investment and an incredibly high level of vulnerability.

Most men can relate to the idea of trying to “pick up” a woman without looking like they’re trying. Or trying to be cool without looking like they’re trying to be cool. Entire books and schools of dating advice have been built on this idea — pursuing a woman without actually letting her know that you’re interested in her.

Just typing that paragraph feels exhausting. Talk about a lot of work for nothing.

Like I described before, this performance-based stuff works sometimes, but it’s a short-term solution that requires a lot of time and effort. In my opinion, it’s a terrible investment of time and effort. You may as well invest that time and effort in yourself and let your identity and honesty do all of the attracting for you.

After all, why learn how to fake being cool, when you can just learn to become cool yourself?

On top of that, walking the tightrope of pursuing her without looking like you’re pursuing her requires a lot of attention and effort. You can slip up easily. It’s very unforgiving and ultimately, not a very enjoyable process. Besides, all of the attention and effort on “gaming” women this way ironically encourages you to be even more highly-invested and needy, therefore decreasing her likely attraction for you.

Men avoid demonstrating an honest interest in a woman because they believe it will signify that they are too invested in her — i.e., it will show that they are needy. They think that when you say, “You’re cute and I wanted to meet you,” that translates roughly to, “Hi, I’m such a desperate loser that I’m just going to throw all of my desires out there right now and beg you to accept them.”

But remember, it’s not the actual behaviors or words themselves, it’s the intentions behind those words. There’s a world of sub-communication going on behind a man’s honest declaration of his interest. And it’s an attractive one.

Because when a man comes right out and says he’s interested in a woman, the sub-communication is actually, “I’m totally OK with the idea of you rejecting me, otherwise I would not be approaching you in this manner. Therefore, I'm comfortable with myself and my prospects.”

Think about it, if a guy wasn’t comfortable with the prospect of a woman rejecting him, he wouldn’t have been honest in the first place. In fact, he would have pretended that he wasn’t actually interested in her!

The fact that he honestly expressed to her his intentions, that he put his nuts on the chopping block and made himself vulnerable to her immediately, actually sub-communicates non-neediness and attractiveness in itself. And on top of that, it shows desire for her, which is going to trigger her arousal.

Remember: what you actually say doesn’t matter; why you say it matters.

Always. No exceptions. You can have the best line in the world, but if you’re saying it because you’re needy and desperate for validation and approval from women, then she is immediately going to sense it.

This is why using pick up lines is ultimately a futile process. I could sell you the best 100 things I’ve ever said to women, but I can’t ever sell you my intentions or my confidence in myself. You must develop those on your own. And once you do, the actual lines you say will be personal and congruent to you and nobody else.

### The Truth Is Always Shining Through

This is because the truth is always shining through. You can’t fake vulnerability and you can’t fake honesty. By their very definition, it’s impossible.

Men’s dating advice gives women very little credit when it comes to this. Women are generally quite intuitive to emotions, motivations, and social cues. We may think we’re clever when we come up with a cute line to approach a woman with, thinking that she has absolutely no idea that we’re secretly hitting on her. She does. They always do. And it’s not a big deal either.

And not only does she know we’re hitting on her, the fact that we seemed so concerned about getting rejected turns her off. The fact that we had to contrive lines and fake stories in order to start a conversation with her, whether consciously or not, signals to her that we are highly invested and not a truly attractive man.

You cannot fake non-neediness for more than a moment. The only women you will manage to fake are women who are drunk or who are extremely needy themselves. Truth.

Non-needy and truly high-quality women who are not invested in the attention they receive from men are not going to have much patience for your lines and games. They will either see through them and see you for who you really are — scared to expose your vulnerability — or they will simply assume you’re not worth investing in because you’d rather just talk about spells or games or whatever.

Vulnerability requires honesty, and honesty only works if it’s given unconditionally, with no strings attached. That means everything you say and do must be done without any ulterior motive. You are simply expressing your thoughts and feelings as they come to you, without inhibition, without shame.

The truth is always shining through. Even if you lie about yourself or act a certain way, this is actually saying much more about you and your character than the content of your statements. Even if you are exaggerating or putting on a bit of an act to impress a person, your intentions will always shine through, eventually, and they will say more about you than any word ever could.

If you pretend you don’t like a woman, ignore her, act like what she says is stupid or uninteresting, when in fact you do like her, and you are interested in what she says, subtle cues in your behavior and body language will slowly but surely tip you off. The armor will crack. It may be laughing too much at your own joke. Or tilting your head away at an awkward moment. Or making an awkward comment to her friend that feels forced. But people’s bullshit detectors will eventually go off, and you’ll be exposed for not presenting an honest expression of yourself.

But what about men who gush about how beautiful a woman is to flatter her? What about the men who buy women drinks and beg them for dates and call them incessantly and tell them how they’re always thinking about them? Those guys are being honest about their intentions and their feelings, but they’re not getting anywhere, are they?

Here’s the problem: human nature is such that we don’t trust people who like us if we don’t feel as though we earned it somehow. Imagine if some “stranger came up to you, started complimenting you incessantly, buying you things, how would you react?

You’d probably think to yourself, “OK, what’s this guy selling?” Or maybe, if he was particularly pushy and weird, “Jesus, is this guy an ax murderer?”

That’s because they’re showing how invested they are in your approval without them actually knowing you, without them taking the time to connect with you and understand you. And as a result, you don’t trust them. You find them creepy and weird.
Welcome to every day of an attractive woman’s life.

Men like this are broadcasting their neediness like a giant neon billboard coming out of their ass. They come up and gush to a woman about how amazing she is while they’ve only known her for 10 seconds. They buy her things with only knowing her for a few hours. What this man is signaling to her is, “I don’t know you, but I’m already going to do anything to win your approval, that’s how desperate I am.” And it comes across as pathetic.

And even on a deeper level, what these men are sub-communicating is something else: “The only value I have to offer as a man is money and compliments. I have nothing else going for me.”

__A man with an attractive and interesting lifestyle, a man with high standards for himself and the relationships in his life, will take the time to get to know an attractive woman before soliciting her with gifts. He will wait until he feels strongly enough to genuinely give her a compliment. And if he talks to her and discovers that there is little that is interesting about her beyond her looks, then he will lose interest.__

Ironically, it’s these high standards and self-regard that women pick up on and find incredibly sexy. And it’s these same standards and self-regard that most men spend a lot of time trying to fake.

When in doubt, check your intentions.

Think about it: the average guy at the bar who goes around buying cute girls drinks — why is he buying them? So the girls will sit there and talk to him. 

When he comments on how beautiful they are and how he’s so infatuated with them, why is he complimenting them? So that they’ll like him. When he pays for fancy dinners and offers to buy them jewelry, why is he doing it? So they’ll be impressed with him and not leave him.

These are not gifts or compliments at all. These are deals he’s brokering. The terms may be implied or unspoken, but they’re transactions all the same. Everything he gives to her, he is giving with the expectation to receive something in return. The drinks are not unconditional. They’re bought with the provision that she stays and talks to him. The compliments are spoken with the provision that she shows him affection in return.

And when the women don’t show appreciation or don’t reciprocate interest, he becomes furious, blaming the women for being gold-digging, lying whores and bitches. Again, being a “nice guy” is never much different than being a narcissist. One only gives. The other only takes. But both are the same in their desperation for approval.

This is a subtle form of manipulation and, therefore, at its core, dishonest.

Once again, most high value, confident women will see through this immediately and not hang around a man who does this. In fact, the only women who will go for a man like this are women who are superficial and willing to trade their affection for material and superficial gain — these women are soulless and suppress their emotions as much, if not more than the men who buy things for them.

An attractive man expresses his interest unconditionally, expecting nothing in return. This arouses women and when they do reciprocate his interest, their interest is, in fact, a gift in return.

True honesty is only possible when it is unconditional. The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift — when nothing is expected in return. When I tell a girl that she is beautiful, I say it not expecting anything in return. Whether she rejects me or falls in love with me isn’t important in that moment. What’s important is that I’m expressing my feelings to her _in that moment_.

I don’t use my compliments as a bargaining tool. I give them unconditionally. A needy man will give a woman a compliment without knowing her and wait expectantly for her to repay him in either her company or with thanks or with sexual favors. I will give compliments only when I am honestly inspired to give them, and usually after already meeting a woman and displaying to her that I’m willing to disagree with her, willing to be rejected by her and willing to walk away from her if it ever comes to that. This willingness to walk away from her and this ability to accept nothing in return is what gives my genuine interest so much value.

When a compliment comes from a man seeking nothing in return, it’s a gift of truth, a piece of his vulnerability and infinitely more powerful as a result.

And this honest compliment inspires women to become more highly invested in return. Paradoxically, seeking no investment from her will inspire her to invest that much more in you.

Beautiful women are complimented on their looks often, and 99% of these compliments are given out of neediness, out of some idealization of who she is or what she can do for him.

Beautiful women have been conditioned for most of their lives to know when a man is being genuine or not, whether the compliment is a gift or a bartering tool.

And when it is a gift, when it is honest, she recognizes and appreciates a man who genuinely appreciates her. These men are rare.

Women are people too (radical idea, I know). And as people, we all value those who genuinely value us, not expecting something in return.

The biggest aphrodisiac in the world is someone who likes you, genuinely likes you. A woman’s desire is to be desired. But it has to be genuine desire. It can’t be a, “I’ll desire you as long as you “boost my ego and impress my co-workers,” kind of desire.

The point is that genuine no-strings-attached appreciation is rare in this world, particularly from men. Women value this and invest themselves in the rare man who can demonstrate his vulnerability to her.

Here’s the litmus test. Look at your actions and words around women and look at the intentions behind them. These intentions are always speaking ten times louder than your actual words. What are they saying?

If you bought a girl a drink so that she wouldn’t leave to talk to someone else, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested in her and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you told a girl a story in order to impress her and make her like you, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you invited a woman to a restaurant in order to impress her with how much money you had, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman’s attention or affection through entertainment, money or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.

I should add that these aren’t all-or-nothing propositions either. Look, we all want people to like us, and we all like to impress others. We all need some validation sometimes. We all do these things to certain degrees. It’s impossible to be perfectly non-needy all the time.

But neediness is relative. That’s why I say it’s about being less invested in others’ perceptions instead of NOT invested in others’ perceptions. It’s an important difference.

I’m not advising to become a heartless sociopath. Quite the opposite, really. Because the more you invest in yourself, the freer you will become to care for others around you without looking for anything in response. A man who is needy and does not invest in himself is ultimately only capable of superficial interactions because his threshold for vulnerability is so low.

It’s impossible to be completely devoid of investment in other people. That’s how we’re wired. But it is always possible to invest and care about yourself more.

### Setting Boundaries

But delivering honesty unconditionally isn’t just about compliments and appreciation. Unconditional honesty can be brutal and scathing at times as well. And strangely enough, brutal and angry honesty can turn a woman on just as much as the most genuine compliment.

Again, it’s not about what’s being said, it’s about the intention and sub-communication behind it. 

When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when you feel that she’s out of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate in your life, this sub-communicates the most powerful elements of attraction to her. Far more powerful than an entertaining story or game.

This is why it’s quite possible to piss a woman off and turn her on at the same time. Any man experienced with women will be familiar with this.

If a beautiful woman says something that a needy man finds offensive, he’ll ignore it, change the topic, or withhold his true feelings. Hell, he might even pretend to go along with her for fear of making her upset.

__But a non-needy man will tell her what she just said was offensive. Let the chips fall where they may. He won’t be an asshole about it. He will simply draw a line in the sand, “I don’t like stuff like that,” and she can choose to step across it or not.__

Narcissistic men often misconstrue this as a free ticket to tell people they’re always wrong or to basically do what they want without paying attention to the feelings of others.

That’s over-compensation and actually the behavior of someone who is over-invested and validated by the reactions of those around him.

A non-needy man does not seek to impose himself on the boundaries of others, he’s merely interested in maintaining his own boundaries while respecting the boundaries of others.

__Non-neediness means you respect yourself AND others. Narcissism means you only respect yourself. Neediness means you only respect others.__

The difference is that if a woman says something offensive, a narcissistic man will berate her and try to get her to change her mind, whereas a non-needy man will simply make it clear that he found what she said offensive and will not tolerate it again. How she responds is her choice.

If a woman insults a non-needy man’s friends, he will not hesitate to tell her to stop and stand up for those he cares about. If a woman says she needs to “leave a date after 30 minutes, he will not try to trick her into staying or beg her to come back, he will not yell at her or lecture her on manners. He will smile and say, “Nice meeting you,” and let it go.
Hold your line. Don’t go around breaking somebody else’s.

Most questions or problems men email me with, at their core, somehow involve a failure to maintain their boundaries. Whether it’s about a date, a woman not calling him back, a woman making fun of his job, or whatever, his perceived “problem” is simply him not stepping up and telling her what he’s willing to accept and not willing to accept in his relationships.

Typically it has to do with something like the following: “She really liked me and gave me her number. She responds to my texts, but when I tried to get her out on a date, she made excuses. So then I texted her some more and she said she wanted to see me, but when she did show up for the second date, she was late and said she had to go early. She didn’t kiss me. Now I’m texting her and she’s texting back but won’t agree to go on a third date. What do I do?”

Usually, men like this are obsessive about “the games women play” or how to deal with “tests” from women.

My answer to these men is always the same: if you make it clear from the beginning that you are unwilling to put up with games, then not only will the women you attract stop playing games, but you’ll stop attracting women who do.

In the example above, my plan of action? I would have said to her, “Let me know when you’d like to get together again. If you’re not interested, that’s fine too.”

Yes, I will actually say this to her. Not in a harsh manner. But in a clear manner.

I’ve said something similar to women probably 5-10 times. Without exception, they’re completely stunned. Often, they immediately apologize and say that they didn’t mean to be so flakey. Oddly enough, my honesty and complete willingness to be rejected (or to reject them) demonstrates my non-neediness and often it causes them to become more attracted to me.

And a couple times, they’ve said, “You’re right. I don’t want to date you,” in so many words. And that’s OK. Yeah, it hurt to hear that. But a lot of shit in life hurts. Get over it. It’s for the better. She just saved us both a lot of time and effort.

Your ability and willingness to establish boundaries is inversely proportional to how needy you are. Men who are needy and lack vulnerability will keep their boundaries loose and open, inviting manipulation into their lives and allowing people to walk over them. This is because they are more than willing to alter themselves in order to receive validation from the women they meet.

Men who are non-needy establish strict boundaries because they value their own time and happiness more than receiving attention from a woman. They also see no reason to trample over other people’s boundaries.

When it comes to making yourself more vulnerable, the first step is often to begin establishing your own boundaries. Learn how to say no to people, particularly women. Start having opinions on what you like and don’t like, what you’ll tolerate and won’t tolerate. Be honest with yourself, painfully honest. And then be painfully honest with her.

The problem with forming strong boundaries is that in order to form them, you have to be particularly aware of your own desires and emotions. And many men who have been needy their entire lives are not very self-aware. They don’t know what they’re willing to stand up for and what they’re willing to let slide. They don’t know their own emotional motivations and desires.

Men will often have to spend a lot of time seeking truth within themselves first before they’re able to express it to others.

### Finding Your Truth

It’s important to look at the reasons why you’re over-invested around women and have an honest discussion with yourself about it to try and resolve it.

For instance, perhaps you’re over-invested around women because you’re a virgin and have no experience with them. Then you need to look at how being inexperienced is causing you to undervalue yourself and seek validation. You must become comfortable with the idea of being inexperienced and be comfortable admitting that insecurity if you wish to gain a lot of experience.

Or perhaps your ex-girlfriend left you for another man and you’re bitter. Before you can undo the anger that is causing you to be over-invested, you need to come to terms with why you’re angry and accept why your ex left you.

For me, a big part of this was accepting that, actually, I had been a pretty naive and shitty boyfriend to my ex-girlfriend and I could understand why she would want to leave me. I also recognized flaws and insecurities in her that I hadn’t noticed when we were together and that she hadn’t been the perfect angel that I assumed she was. All in all, I came to terms with the experience and the anger receded, allowing me to let go and become less invested in women I dated.

Another example is a guy who has never been “cool” before. Perhaps he was picked on growing up and made fun of all through high school. Maybe the popular guys in school told him he was gay and a pussy.

Perhaps now he’s older, better looking and more social and is looking to compensate for all of those years of feeling insignificant. So he does it by throwing money around and attracting a lot of superficial attention. He’s having fun, but he’s scratching that itch, he’s finally living out that need to be the cool and popular guy. But at some point, he has to come to terms with this, accept it, and become comfortable admitting it. Then he can move on.

Again, if you’re only trying to get women to impress other guys, then you’re not in a very good place, and you need to take a serious look at your motivations. To undo this, you must come to terms with why you’re seeking attention and approval from other men — maybe it goes as far back as your father — and then seek to find that approval through other means. Join a sports team. Take your co-workers out for beers. Buy season tickets to the local basketball team. There are much healthier ways to get male camaraderie than to try and impress other guys by getting girls.

As you’ll see, the book is divided up into three core areas: building a congruent and attractive lifestyle for yourself, overcoming your fears and anxieties, and becoming socially adept at expressing your emotions and sexuality without shame or hesitation.

### Friction and Projection

Attraction is great, but in and of itself, it’s not always enough to consummate a romantic or sexual relationship.
There are two main reasons that prevent attracted women from being with you, and they are both quite common: I call them friction and projection.

Friction is when a woman finds you to be an attractive man, but there are value differences or external circumstances that prevent her from acting on that attraction or being interested in you.


The most common case is the girlfriend/wife. This happens all the time. You meet a woman, you two really click, she’s laughing at all your jokes, smiles when you smile, looks into your eyes a little bit too long…
…and she’s married.

Friction can be religious, cultural or simply due to poor logistics.

Ultimately, your values determine your behavior. And that’s kind of the point of all of this: YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think others want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship.

Projection is completely different. There are a lot of women who, for whatever reason, are afraid of their own sexuality and/or openly sexual men. They harbor trust issues and resentment with men. Usually, this is because they have a history of some sort of emotional/sexual abuse and/or they’ve experienced a long string of disappointments with the men in their life.

When confronted with a non-needy man — a man without these similar emotional hang-ups and distrust — these women will usually be untrusting and lash out in response. They are not lashing out for lack of attraction, but they are lashing out because they are attracted and that strong sexual attraction scares them, particularly if you’re a man who feels threatening to them. Their view of male sexuality is negative and when they are confronted with an honest and attractive man they’ll often attack you and try to tear you down for it.

These are the women who will get angry and say snide things like, “I bet you say that to all the girls,” or will find reasons to push you away and then regret it and want you back. They will pretend to miss your calls and then get angry when you don’t persist in calling them, or they’ll make up excuses to ignore you on a date and then get mad when you don’t behave like a gentleman.

Needless to say, you’re better off without these women. Take the rejection and move on.

Generally, these women are extremely needy, and because of the large investment gap between you two, they will try to project their own investment onto you. They will accuse you of being demanding, overbearing, too horny, untrustworthy, or weak. These accusations will have little to no connection to reality, and a non-needy man will either walk away from a girl like this or simply ignore her accusations if they have no bearing.

The only men willing to put up with such nonsense are men who are highly needy as well. The needy man will spend all of his time placating and trying to fix the accusations and problems the woman projects onto him. And the most messed up part about this is that the needy man will enjoy fixing and placating the needy woman. The needy man enjoys it because this constant “fixing” of the distrusting woman’s fears and accusations makes the needy man feel needed.

If the man is narcissistic, then he will usually lash out right back at the woman and they will engage in a relationship full of petty, unimportant drama, playing out emotions and projecting their histories of pain and marginalization onto each other over and over again, until one of them finally becomes conscious enough to break the cycle and move on. Sometimes this happens quickly. Other times it takes months or years. Either way, it’s always unpleasant.

The uncomfortable truth is that the majority of women are going to have high degrees of friction and projection when you meet them. With most of the women you meet, things are simply not going to work no matter what you do or say. This is to be expected. And this is fine. You are going to be incompatible with most of the women in the world and to hold any hopes of being highly compatible with most is an illusion of grandeur and a figment of your own narcissistic tendency.

Incompatibility is a fact of life. No matter how you behave or what you’re into, the majority of women out there at any given time are simply not going to be interested or emotionally available to you. Our job is not to attract every woman, but to screen for women with a high potential of being attracted to who we really are.

The reality of incompatibility defines our entire strategy of dating women. To base our strategy on anything else is inefficient at best and downright damaging at worst. The world is what it is, it’s our job to simply present ourselves as boldly and clearly to it as possible, accept the reactions and move on the opportunities. Any attempt to control the reactions of others or take some kind of power over the reactions you receive is both foolish and illusory.

# Part II: Strategy

# Chapter 4 : Polarization

A lot of dating advice, particularly of the performance variety, tries to promise the ability to have sex with any girl you want, regardless of... well, pretty much anything. You could be a fat slob living in your mother’s basement, and with the right two or three lines, you too can date a lingerie model (as if there’s a lingerie model hanging out on every street corner).This is a fairy tale. And not only is it a fairy tale, it’s a fairy tale you don’t actually want to live. It feeds your neediness. __Rejection exists for a reason — it’s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.__

Again, the men who are needy and have poor self-esteem are the ones who are willing to completely alter their personalities in order to seduce any woman. The first step to being more attractive is to see rejection as a means to eliminate women who won't make you happy from your life. It's a blessing, not a curse.

So let’s start at the beginning. There are an infinite number of women out there, and we can’t possibly meet or even know all of them. So our first task is to find a way to narrow them down and screen them in a way that we can manage our opportunities better.

### The Three Categories of Women

For practical purposes, we can divide up all of the women you’re attracted to into three categories: Receptive, Neutral and Unreceptive.

Women who are Unreceptive are just that: they’re unavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you. The most common reasons that put women in this category are the following:

* You’re far needier than she is, and she’s therefore not attracted to you
* She has a boyfriend/husband and is happy in her relationship.
* There’s too much friction preventing her from being willing to date you, such as a difference in values, difference in interests, bad logistics, etc.
* She’s not interested or looking for any man at the moment.

__The way to tell if a woman is Unreceptive is if she repeatedly does not reciprocate your signs of interest and/or shows you signs of disinterest.__ If you invite her out for coffee and she keeps making excuses to why she can’t, then she’s Unreceptive. If you call her three times and she never calls back, then she is Unreceptive. If you chat her up and she explains that she is busy and wants to be alone, then she is Unreceptive. __If you hang out with her and she talks about how frustrated she is with her boyfriend and how you’re such a good listener, then she’s Unreceptive.__

No exceptions. Many men waste a lot of time convincing themselves that Unreceptive women may actually like them. A good rule of thumb here is, “if you have to ask, then that’s your answer.” That is, there should be no ambiguity here. And if there is, you can quickly solve it by simply stating to her, “I think you’re cute/pretty/attractive/funny/whatever, want to grab coffee/dinner/a drink sometime?”

Problem solved. You’ll find out where you are very quickly.

But I’m getting ahead of myself…

The next category is Neutral. This category can be difficult for men to understand because it’s not as common for us as it is for women. Typically, a man knows within a few seconds if he’s willing to meet and even sleep with a woman or not.
Women aren’t like that. They spend a lot of time being unsure about a man and need to be swayed one way or the other.

__Women in this category are usually women who you’ve just met or have only spent a little bit of time with. The important thing to know is that women do not ever stay in this category. They eventually polarize one way or the other. And if you never make an advance or show interest in them, then they will usually polarize towards being Unreceptive (this is the Friend Zone, which we’ll cover in a minute).__

Neutral women are generally just that, neutral. They will not necessarily turn down your offers, but they won’t offer or reciprocate themselves. The jury’s still out. They’ll often tentatively say yes, although they won’t seem overly enthusiastic about it. They’re still testing the waters. Or sometimes, they just haven’t considered you in that way yet.

The goal with Neutral women is to polarize them through your words and behaviors. This may mean flirting with them or teasing them. It may mean asking her on a date. It may be as simple as smiling at her from across the room. Whatever it is, the goal with Neutral women is to take an action that forces her to make a decision about how she feels about you. Which side she polarizes to is far less important than actually taking action. And remember, if you leave her to her neutrality, she will usually become Unreceptive and not see you as dating material.

And in the final category, women who are Receptive are women who are sexually/romantically attracted to you. You can recognize women who are Receptive in two ways: 1) they initiate with you, and/or 2) they reciprocate your actions enthusiastically.

Some examples of a woman initiating with you:

* She makes strong eye contact with you and doesn’t break it.
* She approaches you.
* She touches you unprovoked.
* She asks for your number or invites you out with her/her friends.
* She asks you a lot of questions about yourself and seems genuinely interested in you.
* She introduces you to her friends.
* She gives you her number.
* She comes up with some excuse/story/reason for you to hang out with her or spend time with her.

Chances are if you’re reading this book, many of the girlfriends or sexual experiences you’ve had with women in the past only happened because she initiated with you.

That’s fine. But just going about your life, unless you are extremely good-looking or have a great life style or you manage to meet women through good social contacts, few women are going to initiate with you and the few who do won’t initiate often.

In fact, most women, especially very beautiful women, even if they’re attracted to you, won’t initiate with you. Remember, women tend to be less invested before sex, therefore, they (usually) expect men to initiate in the beginning. There are also strong cultural pressures on women to wait for the man to initiate.

The other way women demonstrate that they’re Receptive is when they reciprocate. It’s important to recognize the subtle difference between a woman reciprocating your advances and a woman being neutral toward your advances. A woman who is Neutral will simply not respond at all. For instance, if you touch a Neutral woman on her back while you speak to her, she’ll just act like you’re not touching her.

A woman who is reciprocating will do something to respond positively to your advance. Think of it as her signaling to you that she accepts your advancing on her and likes it. If you touched a woman on the back and she wanted to reciprocate, she would either lean back into you, lean in closer to you, or touch you in return.

Here are some other common examples of reciprocation:

* She ignores her friends to stay and talk to you.
* She keeps very strong eye contact and laughs a little too much at everything you say.
* When you touch her, she touches you in return.
* When you put your arm around her, she leans into you.
* When you take her hand to move somewhere, she holds it in return.
* When you ask her out on a date, she offers a place to go or mentions something she’d like to do with you.

Most interested women will reciprocate on small signals to show that they’re interested in you. Catching on to how women reciprocate and noticing the signals is something that you develop with experience, but it shouldn’t be too hard if you know what to pay attention to.

A lot of the methods of flirting that we’ll cover in Part V will address the specific ways in which women reciprocate and how to handle them.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of women you will meet, assuming you’re a typical guy, will be either Neutral or Unreceptive. This is true for the most of the male population, myself included, so don’t worry.
The percentage of women that you meet in each category will vary widely from man to man and also vary widely depending on the context in which you meet women.

### Strategies for Each Category

Your course of action will differ depending on the type of woman you meet. Many men make the mistake of applying the wrong strategy to the wrong category of women. For instance, they’ll try to convince an Unreceptive woman to become Receptive. Or they’ll treat a woman who’s already Receptive as if she isn’t yet. Not only is this a time waster, it’s also ineffective.”

The goal with Unreceptive women is to identify them and move on as quickly as possible. They’re time sinks. Typically, if women are Unreceptive, they’re Unreceptive for a good reason, and it has little to do with you (or maybe it does has everything to do with you, in which case you should learn from it).

You’re almost never going to change the mind of an Unreceptive woman, and even when you do it’s often not worth the effort.
I strongly believe in the idea of “Fuck Yes or No.” That is, I want women to say “Fuck Yes,” once they’ve gotten to know me. And if they aren’t enthusiastic and excited about being with me, then I’m not interested in them anymore. So Unreceptive women simply aren’t worth my time or effort to pursue. They could be great people and maybe I’ll be friends with them. But the minute they’re Unreceptive towards me, my interests have moved on.

I’ll say this: in seven years, after meeting thousands of women, I can think of maybe five instances where a woman was flat out Unreceptive towards me and I “won her over.” If she shuts you down, tells you to go away, tells you she’s not interested, tells you she has a boyfriend, move on. Seriously, get over it and move on. You’re wasting your time. I don’t care how special you think she is, there’s another one out there who’s just as special who will be Receptive to you.
The two most common time sinks with Unreceptive Women are the Friend Zone and women in relationships.

The Friend Zone occurs when a woman has categorized you as a friend and not a potential lover. For women, these categories are almost always mutually exclusive. A man is either a friend, or a potential sexual partner, but rarely both. There are exceptions, but they are rare.

Once inside of it, the Friend Zone is almost impossible to get out. And if you do ever get out, it’s likely not due to anything you tried or did anyway. Why? Because a man who does not act on his sexual desires is a man who is needy, lacks vulnerability and is therefore unattractive.

The Friend Zone typically occurs when a man meets a Receptive or Neutral woman but never makes a move or expresses his interest. Instead, he behaves pleasantly, like a good friend would. In his mind, this is great because it means she likes talking to him, laughs at his jokes, etc. But because he’s withholding his sexual interest, he’s placing himself in her mind firmly in the “friend” camp.

The Friend Zone is the biggest possible time sink because most men who are stuck in it entertain fantasies that they’re simply waiting for the inevitable to occur. It plays into their fantasies of romance and destiny. Their perspective is that they are the perfect man for her and one day when she wakes up and realizes how foolish she is, she’ll realize that the love of her life had been sitting right there by her side all along.

This never happens. Ever. It’s an incredibly arrogant and manipulative mindset to adopt. It’s no wonder women see it as so unattractive.

__If you are in this situation now, you need to get it out of your head and move on. Immediately. Typically, if men have been friends with a woman for even a month or two without ever explicitly indicating their sexual interest in her, it’s likely too late.__

__You must indicate some sort of sexual interest early on. Otherwise, the longer you wait, the harder it gets and the more likely she will become Unreceptive to you.__ 

The second time sink that men often get sucked into is a woman that is happily in a relationship. Unlike the Friend Zone where men will often waste away months or years, a woman in a relationship will usually only waste a few weeks, maybe a few months at the most. But still, a time sink is a time sink.

A lot of men get hung up on women who are already taken, and rather than cut their losses and move on, they harbor some fantasy that any woman will cheat on her boyfriend/husband given the right circumstance. This isn’t true. And even in the cases that it is true, it’s also not worth the time or effort.

Waiting around for a woman in a relationship is simply not worth it. Period. Trying to sabotage a woman’s relationship so you can swoop in and “steal” her is not only ineffectual but morally fucked up. It’s neediness and narcissism to an extreme degree.

__What a lot of men don’t understand though is that oftentimes, married or taken women will still flirt with other men for no other reason than they think it’s fun and they like the attention. To some women, flirting is like a hobby and they see it as harmless fun. If a woman is married or has a boyfriend and seems pretty happy in general and is flirting with me, then I don’t take the flirting too seriously.__

Men also struggle a lot with the rejection, “I have a boyfriend.” Some men seem to get obsessed about whether this is actually true or she’s just saying it to reject him.

Once again, it’s not about whether her statement is factual or not. It’s about her intention. The intention is, “I’m not interested.”

Take that at face value and move on. Even if she doesn’t have a boyfriend, there’s no point in trying to win over a girl who is willing to lie about something like that to you. And if she does have a boyfriend, then she’s probably happy with him, otherwise, she wouldn’t have brought it up.

And that’s really the crux of the matter: women who have boyfriends/husbands who are willing to cheat on them, don’t bring up their boyfriends/husbands... almost ever. Typically, you’ll hear about them either immediately before or immediately after you hook up with them. If they tell you about them right when you meet them, then they’re not interested. If they tell you about their boyfriend while they’re making out with you in the cab back to your apartment, then she’s probably interested. But you don’t need me to tell you that.

So your mission with Unreceptive women is to spot them as quickly as possible, and then politely move on. Rejection, in this case, is often your friend, as we’ll see later.

It’s not until you find a woman who is Neutral or better that things begin to get interesting.

The goal with Neutral Women is to get them to stop being Neutral as soon as possible. As we mentioned earlier, women who are Neutral and who stay Neutral tend to eventually end up Unreceptive. You do this by expressing your vulnerability and your identity to them freely.

When you express your truth to women, you will polarize them — they will either become Receptive to you or they will make themselves Unreceptive. When you express your truth, if you express more investment than them, then they will be not be attracted to you and will therefore be Unreceptive. Also, if you express your truth and there is a high amount of friction between you and her that cannot be overcome, then she will become Unreceptive.

If you express your truth and demonstrate not only that you’re non-needy but also frictionless for her (similar interests, values, life situation, etc.), then she will become very Receptive. And when I say very Receptive, I mean very.

A big misconception men have is that they think they need to behave in a way that makes every single woman like them – as if women were all the same. This is counterproductive because by altering your behavior to fit whatever she wants, it means you are not being vulnerable and, therefore, you are being needy and unattractive.

Other men often stick to plain jokes and safe topics of conversation that end up not polarizing at all for fear of being rejected. This is also a form of hiding one’s truth, not showing vulnerability, being over-invested and therefore not attractive.

This is the plight of the highly needy “Nice Guy.” He’s afraid of eliciting an emotional response in anybody, especially women (and especially himself); therefore, he’ll play it safe and elicit Neutral reactions from woman after woman. And when women are Neutral for too long without being polarized, then they will make themselves Unreceptive.

If there is one thing that narcissistic men accomplish well, it’s that they will polarize women quickly. Women will know more or less immediately if they’re interested in a narcissistic guy or not because he will be so overbearing and imposing she’ll have no choice other than to feel something for him.

The problem with the narcissistic man is that the few women who become Receptive to him are not the type of women who are pleasant to be around (as they’re highly needy themselves).

As you can see, Neutral women are where so-called “game” comes into play. Having good game means you can take a woman who is Neutral and incite her to become Receptive to you quickly. You do this by making yourself vulnerable, sharing yourself unabashedly, and polarizing her one way or the other and being comfortable with either result.

Finally, we have the Receptive women. Finding these are the best because they are the most rewarding interactions while requiring the least amount of effort. When you meet a Receptive woman, the goal is simple. You escalate. You make a move. You move things forward — assuming you want to, of course.

Receptive women who were originally Neutral, if you do not make a move and become physical with them quickly enough, they will often drift back to Neutral and then to Unreceptive permanently. But I’ve found that women who are Receptive to you to begin with will usually stay Receptive almost indefinitely. I think these are the only rare occasions when you can actually pry yourself out of the Friend Zone — these rare circumstances where she was always Receptive to you, but for whatever reason, you two weren’t able to be together (you had a girlfriend, she moved away for three years, etc.).

__The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status, and your looks. The percentage of women that you’re able to move from Neutral to Receptive will be proportional to how good your “game” is, or how well you’re able to communicate and express yourself with women. And your ability to sort through each type of women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold you are when it comes to meeting women.__

While most pick up advice obsesses over the avoidance of rejection, rejection plays an integral part in my strategy. It’s unavoidable, so I figure we may as well develop a strategy that uses it to help us. Rejection exists for a reason. If you are a professor at a prestigious university, then you’re probably not going to enjoy your time with a high school dropout with an alcohol problem. Just because she has a nice ass doesn’t mean you want to be with her.

Polarizing women into rejecting us — and when I say us, I mean the real us, the vulnerable and unabashed us — does us a favor by sorting out which women are going to make us happy.

Men often want to have it both ways — they want to be able to avoid painful rejections, avoid saying something stupid, avoid embarrassing themselves, while at the same time being this attractive, amazing guy who women fall to their knees for.
You can’t have it both ways.

The two go together. You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others. You simply can’t. You have to be controversial. You have to polarize. It’s the name of the game. And getting good at the game is learning to open yourself up enough emotionally, learning to express your honest self enough and be comfortable enough with your vulnerability to take those embarrassing moments along with the moments of passion. A willingness to polarize is not easy. But it’s necessary. It’s why you’re here right now.

### Polarizing to Attract

Our primary strategy with women is polarization. The idea is that the more forthright you are about who you are, how you feel, and what you think, the more this is going to weed out Unreceptive Women from the Receptive women, as well as push Neutral women to get off the fence and decide how they feel about you.

The amazing thing about polarization is that the simple act of doing it demonstrates non-neediness and will then inspire more Neutral women to become Receptive than other strategies or tactics.

Like I mentioned earlier, the most common strategy by men who are inexperienced with women is “to be liked by all, hated by none.” But when it comes to being intimate and attracting women, this is a horrible strategy. Being hated by nobody usually means you’re not loved by anybody either.

The men who employ this strategy employ it because they’re trying to avoid confrontation and controversy. Many of these men have been avoiding confrontation and controversy their entire lives. It’s part of their fear of vulnerability.

The fact is that sexuality, attraction, and relationships are, by their very nature, confrontational and controversial. You have to either make the decision to accept being controversial and confrontational or you need to accept that you will go through life with everyone being Neutral towards you.

Polarization is what occurs when you express your truth and make yourself vulnerable. When you tell a woman she is beautiful, you are polarizing her. When you tease her about her earrings and put your arm around her, you’re polarizing her. When you wear a custom-made suit when you go out, you are polarizing women. When you tell a woman who’s late to a date to never be late again, you are polarizing her. When you smile and tell her how beautiful she is, you’re polarizing her. When you take her hand in yours and lead her somewhere, you are polarizing her.

Everything that is attractive is polarizing.

These are never wrong moves, assuming that they are honest expressions of yourself and you are showing your vulnerability.
A man who is highly invested is going to alter his behaviors based on the woman he’s talking to. He’s going to be afraid to tell her that he doesn’t accept her being late. He’s going to be afraid to wear that suit out. He’s going to be timid when he wants to put his arm around her. He’s going to be unable to make himself vulnerable, express his truth, and will therefore not polarize her.

A man who is uninhibited about expressing his emotions and what he wants will demonstrate non-neediness, thereby attracting a woman and immediately forcing her to decide whether she’s Receptive or Unreceptive. And chances are, unless there’s a lot of friction present, she will become Receptive. You’d be surprised how many women will respond with attraction to nothing other than a man who is bold and willing to stick his neck out.

A lot of men assume that this means you are inviting a mountain of rejection onto you. The surprising thing is this is rarely the case. Yes, you will get rejected when you polarize women. And yes, every once in a while it will be a harsh rejection.

But surprisingly, a lot of women will react warmly to these advances, even if they’re not interested and reject you. They respect a man who is bold and honest. I’ve had tons occasions where I approached women boldly and honestly, stating directly that they were beautiful and I wanted to meet them, and despite rejecting me, they were so impressed by my boldness and confidence that they promptly introduced me to a friend of theirs who was available.

I’ve often been thanked by the women who I’ve unsuccessfully hit on, not because I did it, but for the way I did it. And even when things go nowhere, women at least respect me and the fact that I bluntly state what I feel.

Most of the harsh rejections I’ve had in my life came from when I was performing, seeking validation, when I was over-invested and needy and overcompensating. When I pursue women in a vulnerable way, almost every woman at the very least will respect my advances, even if she’s not interested.

In my experience, the more polarizing a man is, the more they are flooded with opportunities with women. This is true for every man I know who is incredibly successful with meeting and dating women.

The biggest mental hurdle for many men is the ability to handle rejection. A lot of men have had it ingrained into them all of their lives — and even by other dating advice — that rejection is terrible and should be avoided at all costs. They buy into some myth that there are magical lady’s men out there that don’t get rejected, ever.
And as we’ll see, this is not true.

# Chapter 5 Rejection and Success

Business guru Dan Kennedy once said, “Your ability to deal with the failure will determine how much you get to deal with success.”

As with any type of failure, it’s not until you’ve been rejected a certain amount that you realize how insignificant it actually is, how you spent so much time worrying about nothing, and how you’re free to act however you choose.

### “It’s Usually Not About You”

This is why we pursue women based on our truth. This is why we polarize women as soon as possible. This is why we approach women looking to see if she fits our values and needs and not the other way around.

Most men, when they meet women, are thinking something like, “I hope she likes me,” or “I hope she doesn’t embarrass me or reject me.” It’s all about them. And therefore, when things don’t go anywhere, the men take it personally — they get upset or angry or butt-hurt that this random stranger with breasts isn’t laughing at their lame joke right now.

Instead of thinking, “I hope she doesn’t reject me,” think, “I hope I'll find out if she’s right for me.”

The beauty is that whether she falls in love with you on the spot or she throws a drink in your face… you’ve succeeded. You’ve found out the truth. Your curiosity is fulfilled and you can now decide whether you should move on or not.

I see every rejection simply as some form of incompatibility. Whether she thinks I’m a total creep, or she’s crazy about me but we live on different continents, or she’s in a horrible mood when I ask her out, or she thinks I’m cute but has different values and interests than me — whatever the reason, if a woman ever rejects me, it’s because she’s not compatible with me. It may be a permanent incompatibility. It may be a temporary incompatibility. But the point is that if she liked me enough, she’d be willing to work at making it happen with me. And if she doesn’t, then that just means it’s wrong person — or right person, wrong time. And that’s fine.

Remember, it’s “Fuck Yes!” or no. And if I’m not getting a “Fuck Yes!” then I’d much rather have a no than a “Meh, OK.”

### Redefining Success

I define success in a qualitative way: maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women I prefer to be with.

```
Success = Maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women we prefer
```

When we define success as finding the relationship(s) that will maximize our happiness, our approach takes a completely new light. Instead of waiting and hoping for a woman to select us, instead of racking up numbers, instead of winning bragging rights, instead of avoiding rejections — our success is defined by screening through as many women as possible until we find the ones we enjoy and the ones who enjoy us.

We screen through these women by polarizing them. We are polarizing them by sharing our truth with them openly and freely. And when we do this, women will either become incredibly attracted to us or they will reject us. Either way, we’ll be the happier for it.

So it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty. So far we’ve spent most of the book being introspective and talking about our emotional lives. Whether we get any specific woman or not depends on our level of investment relative to our investment in ourselves. This is non-neediness. We build non-neediness through vulnerability. We practice vulnerability by being honest.

There are three ways in which we are honest. And those three ways will make up the bulk of this book. The three ways are 1) living based on our values (lifestyle); 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions (boldness); and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely (communication).

The first way of expressing our truth involves developing a lifestyle that makes us happy. The second way of expressing truth is by being courageous and fighting through our fears and anxieties. And the third way of expressing truth is by communicating well and being uninhibited in our sexuality.

Choosing to not live a lifestyle based on our values and interests is only being dishonest with ourselves. It reflects a higher investment in others than in oneself. Therefore, it is unattractive.

Not acting on our desires and asserting ourselves where appropriate is showing more investment in others than ourselves. It is therefore unattractive.

And not communicating our thoughts, feelings, and desires freely and clearly also demonstrates more investment in others than in ourselves. This is also unattractive.

Lifestyle, Courage, and Communication: I refer to these as the Three Fundamentals.

# Chapter 6 The Three Fundamentals

The Three Fundamentals are the three ways in which a man can become more vulnerable and become less needy. Improving each one of the Three Fundamentals will improve your results, sometimes drastically. Each of the Three Fundamentals can be worked on independently, but as we’ll see later, improving one of the three often indirectly benefits the other two and vice-versa.
The Three Fundamentals are:

1. Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.  
2. Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.  
3. Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.  

The way to improve each of these fundamentals is by drilling deeper into your vulnerability for each one of them. So one way to think about it is that the fundamentals are the categories in which you can improve your results with women (and general well-being), and expressing your vulnerability and seeking truth is the process in which you improve in the categories.

__For short, I refer to the Three Fundamentals as Honest Living, Honest Action, and Honest Communication.__

For instance, Honest Living, or creating an attractive lifestyle involves really drilling down and understanding what you want as a man for your life and then working to make that a reality. If you’re in a job you hate with hobbies you hate and friends you don’t like, then no matter what you do or how much money you make, you’re going to have a hard time meeting attractive women that you enjoy and who enjoy being with you. This is because the identity you have adopted does not accurately reflect your emotional needs and desires. You are not living your life honestly, which means you are not investing in yourself, which means you are needy and unattractive.

If your true passion is art and you push paper around at an insurance firm, then you’re not living honestly. You’ve compromised your identity in some way to fit what others have dictated it should be; in this case, you’ve given up what actually makes you happy in order to fit the values or roles of other people in society (having a stable job, working in the corporate world, having a nice house/car, etc.). This displays a lack of vulnerability and neediness.

If those things aren’t actually important to you, then you have a responsibility to yourself to change. Otherwise, you’re always going to be an unattractive man. How so? Because you’re living 40 hours a week, every week, investing your identity in what others want out of you and not what you want of yourself. This is like baseline neediness, and until you straighten this out, you will be needy with every woman you meet, preventing you from meeting the truly amazing women that you could potentially be with one day.

Honest Living correlates directly with the quality of women that you will attract. The more in-tune you are to your lifestyle, the more you take care of your appearance and your health, the higher the quality of women you will attract and the greater percentage of Receptive women you’ll meet.

Honest Action is overcoming your fear and anxiety around women. Our anxiety is another form in which we highly invest ourselves in others’ perceptions and avoid our truth. Like a poor lifestyle, it also seems to be embedded in us and it’s something that requires a lot of thought and effort to repair over a longer period of time.

I call it Honest Action because it is honesty in the strictest terms. If you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of being dishonest with yourself. If you’re standing in a bar, and you see a woman who catches your interest, and you keep looking at her all night because you’re afraid to do something, on a deep level, you’re being dishonest about your intentions and sexuality. You’re being overly invested in her and others’ opinions and are unable to expose your vulnerability.

All fear around your sexuality is a result of feeling inferior or unworthy. If you’re afraid to approach a woman, it’s because somewhere inside you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are in your own opinion of yourself. If you’re afraid to ask a woman to come home with you, it’s because you are afraid of the sexual reality that you want to sleep with her — you’re more invested in her not rejecting you than you are in aligning yourself with your desires.

Overcoming your fear and anxiety will correlate with your overall results with women. The reason being that once a man overcomes his fear of rejection, he’s willing to more or less pursue any woman he wants when he wants. Even if he’s a deadbeat (lacks a good lifestyle) or even if he’s terrible at expressing himself (lacks good communication skills), he will eventually meet women who want to date him and sleep with him by no other means than pure numbers. If he’s willing to approach 500 women with no fear of rejection, eventually at least one of them is going to stick.

Honest Action correlates directly to the quantity of women you meet and attract.

The third fundamental is Honest Communication, or learning to express yourself freely and effectively. This is what most dating advice sells and classifies as “game” — a good sense of humor, the ability to connect with people, telling stories, engaging people’s attention, having charisma, and expressing your sexuality openly. These are all parts of this fundamental.

I call it Honest Communication because it’s learning how to communicate your true intentions and emotions to others clearly. Often we have certain thoughts or feelings, but we don’t know the best way to convey those thoughts or feelings. This third fundamental focuses on how to do that.

Honest Communication will determine the efficiency with which you are able to attract women who are compatible to you. A man who communicates poorly or is unable to express himself clearly will lose a lot of romantic opportunities to “lost in translation” situations — misunderstandings, vague communications, inaccurate assumptions, etc.

### Natural Advantages/Disadvantages

Chances are, you’re already pretty strong in one or more of the Three Fundamentals and weak or mediocre at one or more of them. Where your strengths and weaknesses lie will determine not just the quantity of your results with women, but also the types of outcomes you achieve.

For instance, a man with an amazing lifestyle but poor action and poor communication will be surrounded by beautiful and interesting women but never be with them. Classic examples of this are rich or good-looking men who are still single and frustrated. They may have money, connections, power and meet beautiful women regularly (or have beautiful women approach them), but they’re never able to capitalize on their opportunities.

A man with no fear or anxiety with women will be able to approach and ask out many women, but his effort-to-reward ratio will be poor and the quality of women will be worse. Often a lot of aspiring players fall into this category — they go out 5-6 nights per week, approach dozens of women, fail with almost all of them, but every once in a while convince a drunk sloppy girl to come home with them.

A man with great communication skills but a lot of fear and a poor lifestyle will rarely meet or attract beautiful women, but the few times he does, he will capitalize on his few opportunities. Most so-called “normal” guys are like this. They rarely see opportunities, but when they come along, they take them and do well. The problem with these men is that they never feel like they’re in control of their love lives. They’re always waiting for that next woman who’s interested to come around. And sometimes they end up waiting quite a while.

The Three Fundamentals are interesting in that they explain why a lot of men implement a lot of dating advice or self-improvement and don’t see any actual change in results. If your weakness is that you aren’t able to communicate coherently or empathize with what other people are expressing, then being encouraged to approach 500 new women is going to be an absolute disaster.

If you are broke, live with your parents, and have no job, then being encouraged to spend all of your time and money out in nightclubs is only going to get you a bunch of meaningless sex with mediocre drunk girls who have no better options.
If you are scared to death of saying anything to a woman you find attractive, then the best conversation tricks, teasing and flirting lines, or even openers are not going to help you at all.

But as I said earlier, the Three Fundamentals are interdependent — they feed off of one another. So if your biggest problem is an inability to communicate well, then meeting 100 new women won’t directly benefit you, but the fact that you’re talking to 100 new people will indirectly help your issue. In the same way, being able to communicate effectively will help guys with extreme levels of anxiety in their development because the few times they do work up the nerve to make a move on women, they will usually do it in a smooth and socially-attuned way.

# Part III: Honest Living

# Chapter 7 Demographics

This question of where and in what context you meet women is what I call demographics, and it is by-and-large ignored by pretty much all dating advice out there today. This absolutely boggles my mind since social interactions are always contextual, and therefore, attracting women is always contextual.

The theory of demographics is simple and easy to remember: like attracts like. You attract what you are.
If you’re a successful professional who likes fine wine, studied abroad and dresses well, chances are the type of women you’re going to naturally meet and attract in your everyday life are going to be similarly educated, similar looking women with similar interests and similar success.

When demographics don’t match up, then it causes friction. And as we learned in Chapter 3, friction prevents attraction from turning into intimacy and/or sex.

### Lifestyle Choices

The theory of demographics has advantages as well: if you play to your strengths — i.e., if you focus your time and energy on meeting women in situations where they are likely to share your values, interests, and needs — then you’re going to not only experience a much higher degree of success, but you’re going to meet women you enjoy a lot more.

What I recommend to every man before he even begins talking to women is to sit down for a while and ask himself a few questions:

What do you value in a woman? Honesty? Beauty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Obviously, the answer is “all of the above”, right? So let me rephrase the question: what do you value the most? What is an absolute deal-breaker in the women you date? Prioritize what you look for in a woman. This will help you decide where to look.

* What do you value in a woman? Honesty? Beauty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Obviously, the answer is “all of the above”, right? So let me rephrase the question: what do you value the most? What is an absolute deal-breaker in the women you date? Prioritize what you look for in a woman. This will help you decide where to look.   
* Women with the traits that you value, where do they frequent? Where are you most likely to find them?  
* What do you enjoy doing most? Do you love to read/write? Do you play music? Do you enjoy sports and competitions? What are the events or organizations that you can become involved in that explore your hobbies?   
* If you don’t know what your passions and interests are, take a minute and write down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get involved in that activity or event in some way.   

Demographics affect every interaction you have with women. If there is too large of a demographic mismatch, then the friction will be incredibly high, and no matter how attractive you are, she will not be able to connect with you.

### Beliefs and Self-Selection

Lifestyle choices play an obvious role in the demographic of women we would like to meet. If you like to do yoga, and if you go do yoga, you’ll meet other women who like to do yoga. They’ll likely be attracted to you and you’ll likely be attracted to them. Duh.  

What’s not quite as obvious but just as important, if not more important, is how our beliefs naturally screen the women who come into our lives. When I say beliefs, I mean beliefs about women, sex, relationships, and ourselves.

The idea is that our beliefs are reflected in our behavior, and behavior determines which (and how many) women are attracted to us.

For instance, if you believe all women are sluts and untrustworthy, then the only women who are going to be willing to tolerate your judgmental attitude are promiscuous women who are untrustworthy. Social psychology refers to this as the assortment effect and it's been demonstrated in many studies.

Another example is the belief that women want and enjoy sex as much as men do. This belief was a big one for me. Many men don’t believe that women actually enjoy or fantasize about sex.

So how would this belief affect your behavior and screen the women who are attracted to you?

If you believe women don’t or shouldn’t enjoy sex, then the women who do enjoy sex will most likely not feel comfortable expressing their sexuality around you. And the women who do not enjoy sex will feel like you understand them.

Thus, you’ll be stuck dating a bunch of women disconnected from their sexuality and uncomfortable having sex with you.

But if you believe that women do enjoy sex, then the women who do enjoy sex will feel comfortable expressing their sexuality around you, while the women who are not comfortable expressing their sexuality will not be comfortable around you. Yes, this will invite rejections, but remember, rejections are a form of screening for demographics and in this case, it’s doing you a favor.

You’ll end up with a bunch of sexual and sensual women who enjoy being with you. Nothing wrong with that!

The assortment effect through personal beliefs is incredibly powerful. I think that most “problems” men try to overcome with tactics and techniques could easily be solved by simply questioning our beliefs.

I always like to tell men, “The only thing all of the women you date have in common is you.” What I mean by that is if all of the women you date end up lying and being manipulative, or if all of the women you date are selfish and treat you poorly, or if all of the women you date are meek and have no personality, then likely there is something in your beliefs and behavior that is naturally screening for those types of women.

A blunter way of putting it is: whether you realize it or not, the results you get with women are always your fault.

Becoming a non-needy man requires, first and foremost, a high level of honesty with yourself. Part of that honesty with yourself involves observing and challenging your own beliefs. If you have lived your entire life believing women are untrustworthy or that women who express their sexuality are immoral, then perhaps you should evaluate what kind of women those beliefs are going to attract into your life. And if you don’t want to attract those kinds of women, perhaps you should experiment with changing your beliefs.

The same is true with women and dating. If you meet and date women believing fucked up stuff about them, you will only encourage that fucked up behavior. If you never trust the woman you’re with and are always jealous, then you’re just going to encourage her to do things behind your back. After all, she’s going to get yelled at by you anyway, so she decides to start withholding information.

If you’re condescending and treat a woman like she’s a child who can’t make any decisions for herself, then she will act like a spoiled child and stop making any decisions for herself.
In the therapeutic world, this is often referred to as “enabling:” when our shitty behavior encourages the people around us to adopt shitty behavior.

### Age, Money, and Looks

The touchiest part of demographics — and possibly the touchiest subject of all dating advice — is that of age, money, and looks.

I want to get this out of the way and make it 100% clear. Age, money, and looks matter — in some cases a lot, in other cases, not a lot, but they still matter. And anyone who tells you that they don’t matter is lying.

With that said, age, money, and looks don’t matter nearly as much as most men think. And if you’re aware of the effects of demographics, you can work around them and even work them to your advantage.

When it comes to age, studies show that men’s physical attractiveness peaks at around 31 (a luxury considering women peak around 21) and that our physical attractiveness recedes far slower than it does for women. In fact, studies have found that the average 45-year-old male is still considered as physically attractive as the average 18-year-old male.

The main reason is that studies have also found that women judge a man’s status far less on actual physical dimensions and far more on style, grooming, and how men present themselves. As men, we’re extremely lucky in this regard. Taking a man from a baggy beer T-shirt and ill-fitted jeans to a nice suit with a professional haircut will immediately bump him up 50% in the looks department overnight, whereas with women, it’s a constant and never-ending battle to maximize their physical appearance as much as possible.

Money is nice in that it demonstrates success and implies other positive attractive traits. But again, its utility is vastly overblown. When it comes to money, once again the surveys and studies have some interesting findings.

The first is that money/success matters more depending on your age. The older you are, the more money you’re expected to have and the more successful you’re expected to be in order to be attractive. The other finding is that the less wealthy she is, the more important money will be to her.

This is why the stereotypical gold-digger is usually a very beautiful young woman who grew up in poverty. Women who grow up with money or have money usually don’t care about it as much.

But the fact remains that women perceive men with money the same way we perceive women with good looks: as social status. How each woman defines social status and whether money is a part of that or not is going to vary from woman to woman.
Which brings me to my primary point when it comes to age, money, and looks. Again, it’s about the demographics.

I saw a quote recently that said, “Only lazy women are interested in men with money, because they don’t have anything else going for them.

Ask yourself for which demographic of women are looks and money highly important? Women who tend to only value good looks tend to be women who only have good looks and little else to offer. Women who are highly interested in money are going to be women who don’t have other interests or opportunities in front of them.

What I’m saying is, women who only care about things such as looks and money are usually going to be women who you’re not going to be interested in or who are not going to make you happy. So you’re not missing out on much.

With that said, everybody values looks and success to a certain extent. So it’s not something we can write off completely. You should be as good-looking as you can possibly be. And you should be as financially successful as you can possibly be. And even the most interesting and well-rounded and psychologically healthy women are still going to prefer a good-looking and successful man to one who isn’t. All things equal, looks and money always increase your odds.

But I would just add the caveat that you should be as good-looking as possible for you. You should be as financially successful as possible for you. These are just other avenues in which to invest in yourself.

So yes, looks and money matter. But the question is, how do they affect our results with the majority of women?

__The more money/looks/success you have, the less attractive behavior you need. The less money/looks/success you have, the more attractive behavior you need.__

Another way to think of this is that age, money, and looks are universal demographics, and therefore, an incompatibility in any one of them is apt to cause extra friction everywhere.

But just because there’s friction, or just because there are fewer Receptive women, it’s no excuse for not having success in the long run.

The vast majority of men who get hung up on looks and money get hung up on them because they’re using it as an excuse. It’s absolutely not a valid excuse. A guy who is good-looking or rich still has to work for his results; he just doesn’t have to work as hard as the next guy.

It’s all relative. The key is to 1) recognize your personal interests and strengths, and 2) build upon those personal interests and strengths to quickly attract women in your preferred demographic.

### Social Proof

The concept of social proof comes from influence psychology and is well documented in everything from salesmanship to advertising, to politics, and to attraction and relationships.

The idea is that as humans when we see many other people valuing something, we will unconsciously value it ourselves. For instance, if everybody else is talking about a new movie, we are more likely to want to see it because we’ll uncon“sciously assume that it’s a good or important movie to see. This works with people as well. This is one reason why men in power — celebrities, athletes, etc. — are desired by so many women. The goal, as a man, is to cultivate as much social proof within your demographic as possible.

So, for instance, if you are a high-powered executive at your firm, then you have a large degree of social status and social proof at work. Chances are, the women who work with you are going to have some degree of attraction for you. But if you go to a bar on the weekend and know nobody there, then your social status is back to nothing. You’re just another man there.

Social proof only functions within a demographic itself. That’s why once you’ve narrowed down your demographic, you want to cultivate your connections and put yourself into as big of a leadership position as possible. Don’t just join the intramural ultimate Frisbee team, start organizing it. Don’t just volunteer at a charity event, help find sponsors for it. Don’t just go hang out at a local club, but become a promoter for it.

__Part of living the honest lifestyle is to pursue what you’re passionate about to the fullest extent.__ If you absolutely love visiting art exhibitions, don’t just visit a bunch of art exhibitions, but take an active role in the organization, start a meet up group to find other people who want to visit them, or create a forum for commentary. __Don’t just pursue your interests, become a leader in your interests. Don’t just choose a demographic of women to meet, dominate the demographic.__

### Being Something Versus Saying Something

If there’s one takeaway from this chapter, it’s that __it is far more powerful to be something attractive rather than to say something attractive__. You can say the most attractive sentence in the world, but if it isn’t backed up by who you are, then it’s not going to have any meaning. Whereas if you are something amazing, then anything you say will be attractive because it will be coming from a genuinely attractive man.

Women are attracted to your identity. Words mean nothing. What you say is only a means to buy you enough time to show her that identity. Notice I said “show her” not “tell her.”

A successful man doesn’t need to prove he’s successful by ordering something not on the menu. A powerful man doesn’t have to decree to his date what she’s going to eat that night.

This is why trying to impress women by flaunting an image of what you think is attractive will always backfire. Men can go out and perform as much as they want — for weeks, months, or even years — and they’ll never get good results because they’re not portraying themselves well. They don’t have a clear and successful identity. They aren’t in touch with the way in which they’re living their lives.

When you’re like this man – when you’re focused so much on performing rather than actually being – then you are out of touch with your identity, who you are, and what you want. And when you’re out of touch with yourself, you will fall into the abyss of vague and empty demographics. You will aimlessly claw for whatever woman comes near you. You will be left bewildered at how you seem unable to polarize anyone.

Discovering your truth and establishing your identity is necessary to determine the demographics of women you desire and the demographics of women you appeal to. And, as we’ll see, working your demographics underlies everything else in dating.

# Chapter 8  Lifestyle and Presentation

As men, we’re prone to assume that women perceive attraction in the same way we do. Science and psychology show that this isn’t the case.

Men judge female beauty by physical traits first, personality and presentation second: high cheekbones, facial symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, breast size, etc. As such, we often fall into the mistake that women judge our attractiveness with the same metrics; hence, obsessions with bench presses, height, and penis pills.

Yes, physical measurements play a role in how a man’s appearance is judged, but research shows that other factors are more important.

That’s why I draw the distinction between being good-looking and being attractive. Not everybody is born good-looking. But any man, with some time and effort, can become attractive. And in the end, what women want is a man who is attractive.

For some reason, many men believe that their physical appearance is set in stone and they rarely have any interest in altering it or making any major changes. What they don’t understand is that the same man can present himself in varying ways, some of which are far more attractive than others.

Here are a couple unfortunate truths. The first is that appearance is extremely important. The difference between being perceived as stylish and unstylish is night and day. Yes, you can still be dressed like a bum and get girls, but the difference in the effort-to-reward ratio is massive. A makeover and wardrobe change can make meeting and dating women three times easier literally overnight. Not to mention all of the psychological side benefits of making you feel more confident, more interesting, more excited, etc.

Remember, your outward appearance is a reflection of your self-investment (or lack thereof). And your level of self-investment will make you less needy towards others, therefore making your behavior more attractive. If you don’t put a lot of time and effort into how you look and how you present yourself to the world, women look at that and make unconscious assumptions about your status as a man.

The first and obvious step involves grooming and general maintenance. That means regular showering, shaving and haircuts, wearing deodorant, brushing and flossing your teeth, keeping clean fingernails, and wearing clean clothes.

I should not have to be telling you this stuff, but just in case I do, there it is. The above paragraph is non-negotiable, starting today.

There, now let’s move on to the two biggest factors on your appearance, the two F’s: Fashion and Fitness.

If these two F’s don’t excite you or if your immediate thought is, “Oh, I’ll skip this and go straight to the pick up lines,” then I hate to break it to you, but things aren’t going to get any easier. People are always talking about what the “magic pill” to attraction is. If there was such a thing it would be the two F’s. Bar none, fitness and fashion will do more to attract women in a shorter amount of time than anything else you can do. Being in decent shape and dressing well will make every phase of the process easier and smoother, from meeting women, to attracting them, to getting physical with them, to dating them, to staying in a relationship with them. There literally is no downside to either one.
So listen up and make a serious commitment to yourself, because if you don’t make a commitment to yourself then nobody else will.

### Fashion and Fitness

There are a few rules to dressing well:

1. Wear clothes that fit.  
2. Wear clothes that match.  
3. Dress to your personality.  

### Body Language

Body language is something that can also be fixed in a relatively short amount of time and can immediately make you appear more attractive.

Some studies claim that body language accounts for as much of 60% of all communication that occurs between two people. That’s a lot.

Major body language problems can be addressed consciously and with practice. But your body language will continue to improve as a side effect of becoming less needy and getting plenty of exercise.

Go step-by-step if you must. As you walk down the street, remember: shoulders back, chin up, eyes straight, feet straight, shoulders swagger, arms swing. Always look straight ahead. Don’t ever look down at the ground unless you think you’re about to trip. Look people in the eye as they walk by — particularly attractive girls. You’ll catch people making eye contact with you. You’ll feel the urge to look away. Don’t. __Always make other people break eye contact with you before you break it with them.__ Do it until it becomes a habit.

### Vocal Tonality

Vocal tonality is definitely overlooked by men. It’s not just having a sexy voice that’s important; it’s having an expressive and a loud voice.

We actually have two “voices”: a “head” voice and a “chest” voice. Basically, when you sing, your head voice does the high notes and the chest voice does the low ones. Your head voice breathes out largely through your nose while your chest voice through your mouth. The head voice comes from the throat and the chest voice from the diaphragm.

As you could guess, we want to develop that chest voice. Again, the only way to do this is through conscious practice — reminding yourself countless times to speak from your chest voice until it becomes a habit.

Another problem men have is they often talk too quickly. This comes from a subconscious belief that if we don’t get everything out quickly, people won’t listen to everything we have to say. This is a needy behavior.

Not only do better body language and vocal projection engage other people more effectively, but good body language has also been shown to affect your moods positively. Yes, even shifting your body into a more confident position consciously will make you feel more confident and vice-versa. Even if you do it on purpose and know what you’re doing, it will still work. So start paying attention to your body, how you present yourself, how you sit, how you stand, and the amount of eye contact you’re making. It makes a difference. And it adds up quickly.

### Developing Character

One thing that consistently holds men back is that they come across as just another typical dude or bro. Dime a dozen. We’re pressured most of our lives to go with the flow, go along with what our friends like and just agree with what those around us think.

As we’ve discussed, this is unattractive behavior because it demonstrates a lack of investment in your own interests, passions, and desires. __Attractive men are polarizing and uninhibited. Attractive men make their opinions known. They’ve had unique experiences and ideas. They’ve tried things many people haven’t tried, done things many people haven’t done, and share their ideas openly and freely.__

__Put another way, an attractive man with depth and character is a man who has opinions and openly expresses those opinions.__

When it comes to deciding what one likes and doesn’t like, most men have very lukewarm reactions one way or the other.
“Yeah, that movie’s awesome,” or “Yeah, I like that one,” or “No, I don’t like that show.” It rarely goes beyond that. There’s no sharing of why one prefers one type of music over another, one movie over another, one author over another. And there’s no connection to the emotions driving that preference.

Few men ever stop and actually think critically about why they like certain things, why certain forms of pop culture are popular and others are not. Few have the curiosity to look into new art forms or hobbies and figure out how they feel about them.

Here are some concepts to keep in mind as you go through your life experiencing art and media:  

1. Assume everything has a form of value; it’s your job to find it.
Nothing is stupider than to be prejudiced against a genre of music or type of movie for no other reason than because of some stereotype or preconceived notion about it.

Drop all of this prejudice and adopt this mentality immediately: “there has to be something to this form of art, otherwise it wouldn’t have a following, so I should find out what that something is.” Once you find it, then decide if you like it or not. Whether you like something or not, you should always be able to appreciate it.

2. When expanding your horizons; start with what’s generally considered the best.

I’ll make the following points:  

1. Being a well-rounded individual with opinions will expand your demographics by quite a bit. So yes, none of this is necessary if you want to date a woman who has no interesting opinions herself. But if you want to date brilliant, vivacious women with artistic sensibility, passion and class, then a lot of this is a prerequisite.

2. The second point I’ll make is what my high school literature teacher always told us: “You read literature because you can never meet enough people.” What I take from this is yes, even though reading Hemingway or Milton Friedman’s economic theories may not directly get you laid, what it will do is develop your perspective to be more varied, allow you to be able to relate to more people’s experiences and ideas, and generally have a wider body of knowledge for dealing with people in general.

Ask yourself this: If you were lined up next to 10 random, single men from your town, what would make you stand out from them? Imagine a woman met all 10 of you in a row. What is there about you that would stop her dead in her tracks and make her say, "Wow, this man is unique?" What do you have that they don’t? What can you offer that most other men can’t?

### Bringing It All Together

Developing an attractive lifestyle is a long-term process. It requires a consistent and penetrating look at your actions, your habits and what you’ve chosen to do with most of your time.

Your job, your hobbies, your friends, your interests, are these things mostly a result of what was told to you or pushed on you, or are they things that you consciously evaluated and chose based on how enriching and passionate they made you feel?
These are important questions. No one can live your life but you. And as long as you sleepwalk through life not ever questioning or evaluating the lifestyle you’ve built for yourself, the same behavioral patterns are likely to creep up over and over again.

Men often don’t totally believe me, but poor lifestyle choices afflict all of your interactions and communication when it comes to women. Poor lifestyle choices reflect a lack of investment in yourself, which in turn causes you to be less confident around others for validation.

I first noticed this when I worked with men who still lived at home with their parents. A lot of these men were great guys. They were smart, funny, caring, had interesting hobbies. Some even had a good job, but they stayed with their parents for other reasons (health, etc.)

Yet they got absolutely no results. Women never responded warmly to them, and they never seemed quite as motivated or as confident.

There’s a certain baseline level of independence and self-sufficiency that your lifestyle must give you for you to be able to move forward. If you’re constantly stressed by work, upset by your friends, and in poor health, then no amount of work on your anxieties and communication is going to help much. You’re effectively putting a ceiling on your development and your potential with women.

Get your life taken care of. Get healthy. Find a happy group of friends. Find a few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend your time doing. This increases your self-investment and will make you less needy around others. This, in turn, will give you the courage to take the correct action and the wherewithal to communicate effectively. This is honest living.

# Part IV: Honest Action

# Chapter 9 What Are Your Stories?

Jump to today. I rarely experience approach anxiety consciously anymore. That isn’t to say I’m some sort of badass. I put in my time. I paid my dues. A lot of it was fun and a lot of it sucked and was humiliating. But I did it. I grew. And I’m a better person for it now. Through the basic rote exercise of meeting thousands of women in the most basic or ridiculous scenarios over the years, most of that palpable fear — the hand sweating, the fast breathing, the mind going blank — most of that is gone.

What’s not gone, and as far as I can tell, what will never be gone, is a continuing internal resistance to change, whether it be through outright fear, or subtle subconscious thoughts trying to sabotage me. That never stops. I don’t feel nervous anymore, but I do feel a dreadful judgment and boredom. “Only prissy girls wear crap like that,” “Oh God, she’s one of those girls who’s always on her phone. I don’t have time for this.” Sometimes it happens pre-approach. Sometimes it happens 30 minutes in. Sometimes it happens on the second date. But always, these judgments aren’t accurate portrayals of her. I don’t even know her. Yet I’m judging her. It’s a defense mechanism. My conscious fear has disappeared, but my subconscious resistance is still alive and kicking.

And from what I’ve observed, everybody’s subconscious defense mechanisms are still kicking. The resistance doesn’t go away. It just changes shape. Over the years, anxiety morphs into apathy, which morphs into arrogance. The resistance may come before meeting her or before kissing her or before having sex or before committing to a relationship. We all have our own weak spots, and those weaknesses each have their own form of resistance to the change we want. One boundary simply gets pushed back into another and another.

Whether you feel incredibly nervous before you approach, or if you procrastinate calling women you’ve met, or if you tell yourself that you suddenly magically “don’t feel like” having sex when you’re out on a date with a girl even though she’s obviously into you and wants to go home with you, this is your subconscious resisting change. And your mind is inventing stories to explain that resistance. These stories have emotions tied to them, whether they’re fear, boredom, anger, shame, or whatever — which contribute to keeping you in the same place you are right now. It’s your emotional inertia. It’s the status quo. The mechanisms wired into you to keep you there, safe. And we all have them.

The only important "skill" in dating is learning how to stop buying into your own bullshit, to stop believing your own “stories. The resistance is constant. So you must constantly fight against it, acknowledge the stories you create for yourself, look them in the eye and say, “You know what, I don’t care if she’s on her phone and her ass says ‘PINK’ on it, I want to meet her.” And then do it. Without hesitation. Without fear. And without apology.
Sure, you’ll have to flex your mental and emotional muscles, and build up your body of self-awareness, but here’s the good news: those are the muscles chicks actually dig.

Unfortunately, we all buy into our own bullshit. We all believe our own stories from time to time. And chances are, the more anxiety and fear you have surrounding women and your sexuality, the more of your own stories and bullshit you’ve bought into.

### Defense Mechanisms

Most of us have a lot of fear and shame bundled up in our sexuality. These fears usually manifest themselves in a handful of very specific scenarios:

* Fear of approaching and starting a conversation with an attractive woman
* Fear of stating sexual interest either directly or indirectly (by asking for a phone number, calling a phone number, asking her out on a date, etc.)  
* Fear of initiating sexual contact (typically the first kiss situation)
* Fear of actual sexual intercourse

The majority of men experience at least one of the above fears to some degree when it comes to interacting with women. There is a minority of men who will be completely devoid of one or more of the above fears and a very tiny minority who will be devoid of all of the fears above.

These anxieties are manifestations of neediness and an unwillingness to be vulnerable. Typically, the needier you are in a certain area, the more anxiety you’ll have in that area.

This is unscientific, but in my experience coaching and working with hundreds of men, I’ve noticed correlations between high degrees of anxiety and experiencing one or more of the following situations: lack of a father figure “growing up, emotionally abusive childhood, childhood traumas, strict religious upbringing, strict cultural upbringing, bullying or social ostracism growing up.

The sad fact about anxiety is that once you have it, it’s there and figuring out why it’s there doesn’t help much. You can either avoid it the rest of your life, or you can do something about it.

We’re here to do something about it. This section of the book is called Honest Action for a reason.

I personally think anxiety is the biggest culprit when it comes to preventing men from successfully meeting and dating women. You remove anxiety, and trial-and-error will take care of most of the rest.

Anxiety, almost by its very definition, represents a high level of neediness. Let’s say a beautiful woman sits down next to you and you want to say something to her but are scared to death. The fact that you’re scared to death demonstrates a high level of investment in her opinion of you, and thus a high degree of neediness. This neediness creates a fight-or-flight response in us — a surge of adrenaline, we begin sweating, our mind starts zipping at a million miles a minute, thinking of everything and nothing all at once — and if we do manage to utter a word, chances are we stutter and sputter and make a red-faced fool out of ourselves.

This then leads to further anxiety the next time a beautiful woman sits down next to us.

This is a terrible conundrum, and almost all of us suffer from it in some form or another. I suffered from it horribly and it took me years to undo it. Hopefully, with what I learned, it won’t take nearly as long or be nearly as painful for you as it was for me.

The first step to overcoming your fears is to figure out what your pattern is.

When we are confronted with our fears or anxieties, we have a pattern or strategy that we usually use to deal with them. For instance, my most common pattern is apathy. Whenever I’m confronted with something I’m afraid of, I pretend — or scratch that, I convince myself — that I don’t actually care. Here are some of the most common patterns that I’ve noticed:

1. Blame Game — The Blame Game is where, when confronted with something he’s afraid of, a man blames someone or something else for his fear. In the context of women, the Blame Game will often result in men convincing themselves of stuff like, “Oh, she’s stuck up,” or “She’s just into guys who are good-looking,” or “She’s too stupid for me anyway,” or “This club is too loud to talk to “people,” or “Women in Miami are just bitches, I need to find a new city." The excuses and blame can be petty and ridiculous, but they can also run deep. The awful part of the blame game is that with it come anger and frustration. And if you do it enough, the anger will pile up and you will end up with some pretty bitter and irrational beliefs about women. Men who have played the blame game their whole lives may develop screwed up beliefs like, “All women care about is how much money a guy has,” or “All girls in bars are stupid and shallow.” This can lead to some pretty dark places.”

2. Apathy and Avoidance — This has always been my Achilles’ heel, and it’s quite common. Experiencing apathy and avoidance is exactly as it says: it’s when a “man convinces himself that he doesn’t care or that it’s not important to him. I did this for years. I convinced myself that I didn’t care about meeting women and that it didn’t really matter if girls I liked didn’t find me attractive. Well, after enough months of sitting home alone looking at porn while all of my friends were going through girlfriend after girlfriend, I had a rude awakening: I do care. Apathy and avoidance isn’t the worst response when avoiding our fears with women in that it usually can’t last forever. We’re biologically compelled to pursue women so at some point, instinct will win over. Where it is dangerous is in other areas of our life such as career, family or hobbies. The apathy and avoidance pattern is the root behind the couch potatoes and disgruntled office workers of the world.

3. Intellectualizing — I guarantee that this is part of the reason you’re here: you have some sort of fear, anxiety or pain related to women, and instead of actually doing something about it, you got online and decided to look up an answer that you could study.

Intellectualizing is sometimes beneficial in that you can learn a ton of information about a lot of subjects, and sometimes, the intellectualizing will lead to more self-awareness and help clarify what sort of action you need to take. But there are many men who use intellectualizing as just another form of avoidance. It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

But when it comes to women, this is not the answer (says the guy who wrote a 200-page book on women). Honestly, if you went out and talked to women for a year without ever reading a word of dating advice, you’d probably do OK, assuming you were honest with yourself and able to learn from your mistakes. Sure, this stuff all helps, but in the end, your best teacher is your experience. There comes a certain point where learning more about a subject is no longer beneficial and on the contrary, is just going to get you more mixed up and confused, since you have no experience to actually apply your knowledge to.”

Intellectualizing also ends up having a backlash. Once you study a subject enough, it can actually increase your anxiety. By studying it so much, you’ve put more pressure on yourself to succeed and, therefore, build up higher expectations for yourself.

There are more patterns, but these three above are the main ones that I’ve run into with men trying to overcome their anxieties.

Also, there’s a pattern within each of the responses to fear listed above: they aim to avoid the fear and they usually do it by convincing themselves of something that’s not necessarily true.

The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s her fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself that he needs to learn and understand more first. In the end, they're all avoiding what they're afraid of.

Also, realize that no one uses just one defense mechanism. We all use each of them some of the time. In fact, we may stack them on top of each other. For example, “I don’t care what the girls think here because they’re all stuck up bitches, so I’m going to go home," neatly stacks apathy on top of blame.

With that said, we all seem to have a favorite pattern that we fall back on the most often.

The key to overcoming your fears is first and foremost to break your patterned response to your fear. This requires a certain level of self-awareness and discipline.

So for instance, when I was learning to approach women, I had a lot of fear and anxiety. And my pattern was apathy. So I’d be hanging out in a bar, see a cute girl I liked, and my immediate reaction would be to say something like, “Eh, I don’t really feel like talking right now,” or “I don’t feel like meeting girls right now.” This was complete bullshit. I had purposely gone out that night for no other reason than to meet women. I had been reading books and websites all week about nothing but meeting girls. I wanted to meet girls.

It wasn’t until I became aware of this pattern that I was able to start breaking it and forcing myself to talk to that woman I wanted to talk to, even when my mind was telling me that I didn’t want to.

### You Are Not a Victim

I believe strongly in taking responsibility for everything that happens to you in your life. Our minds are always looking 
for ways to avoid pain and failure and rejection, and so they constantly churn out rationalizations to keep us impeccable; it’s them who fucked up, not us. We're fine. We did everything right. It's that fucked up world's fault we're not happy.
Blame is yet another form of neediness. It’s prioritizing others over yourself. As long as it’s their fault, then you don’t have to make yourself vulnerable.

But when you practice taking responsibility for everything that happens in your life, you stop blaming others. It becomes less a question of blame and more a question of sacrifice. It’s no longer their fault that you’re still single because they’re all cold bitches, but now it’s your fault and a question of whether you’re willing to sacrifice the extra effort or not to find a woman who isn’t a cold bitch. Taking responsibility and morphing blame into sacrifice empowers you. It puts the ball in your court and returns you to the healthy reality that the only person in this world who determines your success and failure is you.

### Sexual Motivation

Napoleon Hill wrote a famous section in his classic work Think and Grow Rich called “Sexual Transfiguration.” Hill noticed and theorized that extremely successful men also had extremely high sex drives. And not only did they have very high sex drives, but they also channeled this sexual energy into their work and their accomplishments. Often they would abstain from sex or masturbation for long periods of time and would, therefore, feel more energized.

Science is starting to back this up. Orgasms, or more accurately, ejaculation in men, actually causes a depletion of various hormones and endorphins which often lead to useful behaviors as well as motivation.

Men who have masturbated constantly since adolescence often masturbate so hard and furiously that they desensitize their penis to realistic scenarios. When you masturbate three times a day for years straight, you often have to grip yourself very hard and rub furiously to get off. This can often lead to sexual issues and impotence when a man actually does get into bed with a woman. This is because vaginas are soft, they’re wet, and the sensations they give you are subtle. Your iron-fisted grip does a horrible job of preparing you for the warm lady love.

### How To Overcome Anxiety

Think about it. Why do women spend so much time and effort on their appearance? Why do they go to singles’ bars and join dating sites and give blind dates a try? They don’t do it so that they can revel in rejecting a bunch of guys. They’re just as lonely and frustrated as we are. They want to meet a man. But not just any man, a great man — a man who is confident, charming, fun, and interesting. A man who is non-needy, who is vulnerable, and who will honestly express himself to her.

She wants you to be that man. She’s secretly rooting for you. She doesn’t want to reject you. Every time a new man walks up to her, she’s secretly saying to herself, “Please, please, please be the man. Be the attractive man that I can’t say no to.” And then he nervously stutters around buying her a drink and makes uncomfortable jokes about the weather and she’s back to that horribly uncomfortable position of having to reject him again.

Other times it doesn’t even get that far. It’s obvious before he even opens his mouth that it’s game over. He’s dressed like a clown or hasn’t combed his hair in three months, or he’s too drunk to even look at her directly.

It’s because you didn’t give her that feeling. You didn’t make her spin and fall and laugh and forget where she was or who she was with. That’s what she goes out looking for: the man who can make her feel more alive.

The next time you make your move, when she sees you coming — and trust me, she usually sees you coming — know that she’s already rooting for you. Secretly, she wants you to succeed as much as you do. And for a moment, she’s your biggest fan.

And your role as a man is to take action. It’s all on you. It’s always on you. You move things forward.

And this is where the vast majority of men falter. An action as simple as opening your mouth, moving your feet in the right direction, or picking up the phone — they simply don’t do it. The fear and rationalizations mentioned in the previous chapter are too large. It feels too overwhelming. And nothing gets done.

And ultimately, no matter how much you read, how much you study, how much you watch about dating and attracting women, if you’re unable to take action, you will get nowhere.

The idea was that if you had a crippling fear of approaching women, then you sign up for a “boot camp” or program where a coach takes you out to a bar and more or less yells at you until you approach 25 women in one night. What you say and what happens is all over the place, but at least you’re getting off your ass and doing something.

The problem with the overload method of taking action is that it’s short-term and doesn’t create a lasting habit. There’s a simpler and less stressful method for achieving long-term results over your anxieties.

### The Guide to Overcoming Your Anxiety

In Buddhism, there’s a saying, “What you resist will persist.” And it’s true in this case as well.

The proper way to handle your fear and your anxiety is to accept it, recognize that it’s normal and a part of who you are, and to not even try to hide it from the woman you’re meeting.

Psychological research actually shows that people perform better at activities under a certain amount of anxiety. In fact, what matters isn’t the anxiety itself, but the person’s confidence in their own ability to perform whatever action they’re anxious about.

So it’s less about the anxiety and more about how competent you feel you are. The less competent you feel, the more the anxiety will hinder you, the more confident you are in your ability, the more the anxiety will help you.

The same is true with our fears.

The way to attack anxieties is through incremental, consistent exposure. Not single, extreme exposure.

Find something easy, but repeat it regularly for a while, until it doesn’t feel difficult anymore.

Slowly work up until you’re able to approach women by telling them you think they’re attractive and asking them out on a date. You’ll be surprised how quickly you can get comfortable doing this.

In fact, if you’re like most guys and stick with it, then you’ll begin to get hooked to the adrenaline rush and actually enjoy the butterflies you get when you approach a new woman.

Eventually, you’ll be able to approach any woman in any circumstance and express your interest in her without fear, without worrying about what to say or what line to use.

And you can apply this to all sorts of situations: getting physical with women, emailing women online, calling phone numbers, sexual humor, conversations with women, etc., etc.

It’s just a matter of knowing how to structure your exposure.

Get creative. Other sticking points this method can be applied to:

* Stalling out in conversation. Being comfortable talking about yourself.  
* Calling girls and asking them out on dates.  
* Going for sex once you’ve been out on a date with a girl.  
* Flirting and teasing women.
* Showing direct interest. Stating that you’re attracted to them.

### Courage and Boldness

Feeling fear and acting despite it builds courage. Anytime you’re afraid to do something and feel some invisible force holding you back, yet you push through it anyway, you’re building courage within yourself.

Courage is a habit. Courage is a form of discipline. It’s taking a certain action even though you feel like doing something else. The difference here is that courage involves acting against fear, whereas discipline involves acting against laziness or fatigue.

Courage is built like a muscle. The stair-stepped exercises in the previous section are designed to progressively build your courage. The more courage you build, the more you’ll be capable of bold actions. Bold actions require a lot of vulnerability and build non-neediness.

The bolder your action, the greater attraction you’re going to create. The bolder the action, the more vulnerability you show, and the more you polarize responses.

If you walk around and ask women for the time, you are not polarizing them very much. Most of them will give you the time. The worst rejection you’ll ever get may be, “Oh sorry, I don’t have a watch,” or something similar.

But if you walk around and ask women on dates, you’re going to get polarized reactions — nervous and excited yes’s, and tense and reserved no’s. Or maybe a few angry no’s. If you go even further and try to kiss a woman at an unexpected time, you’re either going to get a very enthusiastic yes or an enthusiastic no.

The point is: greater boldness leads to greater polarization.

This is yet another argument for behaving in an assertive manner. This is also why one of my mantras that I tell men is, “Always err on the side of assertiveness.

Whenever you’re in doubt of what you should do, err on the side of assertiveness. Choose the bolder action. Because if you wait around for the safer and less bold opportunity to make a move on her, chances are the attraction will be less or may even dwindle.

But bold behavior by itself will only go so far. Boldness must be molded by charismatic and efficient communication. Just behaving recklessly and will attract some women to you, and will give you sexual opportunities (particularly in party environments), but without communicating in a charming and interesting manner, and without being aware of social norms, it’s unlikely you’ll get many women to stick around, and your relationships will not be that enjoyable.

You can build up an incredibly attractive lifestyle and persona, focus on the proper demographic, act boldly and pursue women shamelessly, but if you can’t communicate to them your intentions and your personality well, then it will be hard to maintain their interest for very long.

# Part V: Honest Communication

# Chapter 11

### Your Intentions

All the way back in Chapter 3, we talked about how vulnerability only holds weight when it’s communicated unconditionally — that is, when you compliment a woman or express yourself, you’re not doing it with an ulterior motive, you’re simply expressing yourself.

In this chapter, I’d like to take that idea further.

Men mostly communicate through facts, stories, and data. We discuss sports statistics, how we fixed our car last weekend, and where we plan on going next month. If a man says, “I’ll see you at 6 PM,” he typically means it literally. If a man tells you that he used to be the best basketball player at his college, you take it at face value, even if he may be exaggerating a little bit. If a man says he dislikes you, then it means he’s not your friend anymore and you move on.

Women communicate more in feelings and, more specifically, through intentions. Sure, they still pay attention to the facts and stories on the surface, but what’s actually communicated to them is the intention and feeling underneath.

This is sub-communication.

This is why your girlfriend can get upset and tell you she hates it when you spend time with your friends one night, and then the next night she insists you go to your weekly bowling league and not see any contradiction in her statements. On the first night, she felt like you weren’t paying enough attention to her. On the second, she felt secure with you and wants you to be happy. The issue wasn’t actually your friends, it was simply her feeling valued.

Needless to say, this sort of stuff often confuses the hell out of men, often for an entire lifetime.

Some dating advice tells men not to compliment a woman too early or too often. The reason for this is that most men who read dating advice have poor intentions: they’re needy and looking to validate themselves through sex or female affection. So when a man compliments a woman out of neediness, it’s going to make a woman feel uncomfortable and objectified.

Now if a man compliments a woman out of genuine appreciation for her, she’s going to hear his intention and be genuinely appreciative of him as well.

Teasing and flirting with women is another great example. Many men, when they first begin trying to flirt with women, will tease them or “neg” them. Ask yourself this, what’s the difference between a tease and an insult? Both are derogatory statements. Both often incorporate humor. So what’s the difference?

Intention. Teasing is done with a fun and positive intention. Insults are done with a negative intention.

Or what’s the difference between sharing yourself and bragging? Let’s say you are friends with a celebrity. What’s the difference between sharing your life experience with a woman (attractive) and bragging to her (unattractive)?

Hopefully, you’re catching on by now: it’s intention. What is your intention? Are you trying to impress her (needy) and therefore bragging? Or are you sharing yourself (vulnerability) and therefore polarizing her?

This relates directly back to what we talked about in Chapter 1 in regards to investment, neediness, and validation. A man who is extremely needy will have intentions dominated by seeking validation and approval and will therefore be unattractive regardless of just about anything he says. A man who is non-needy will have intentions dominated by vulnerability and will therefore be attractive regardless of what he says.

### Creepiness

The number one fear deterring men from openly expressing their sexual desires towards women is a fear of being perceived as “creepy.”

Before we jump into what creepiness is exactly, and what women mean when they complain about it, I need to give the same type of painful-truth serum I gave for rejection:

_There’s no such thing as a man who is adored by women who isn’t also creepy some of the time._

The fact of life is that if you are a man who expresses his sexuality freely (and you should), some women, some of the time, are going to find you creepy. It’s simply unavoidable. No matter how cool, rich, good-looking and charming you are, at some point, somewhere a woman is going to be creeped out by you. Live with it.

So as a wise friend of mine sometimes says, “Give yourself permission to be creepy.” Don’t try to be creepy. And definitely don’t walk around looking to intimidate women. Simply accept that sometimes, miscommunications happen, awkward situations occur, and things get misconstrued. Such is life. As long as you’re respectful in how you express yourself, there should never be a serious problem.

There’s no other way. And look, it’s not the end of the world. There’s no Creepy Police who come and handcuff you and throw you in Creep prison where you’ll wait for you court date where you’re charged for being creepy in the third degree.

Creepiness is one of these vague concepts that everyone knows, but no one can really put into words. If you ask women what creepiness is, they’ll give you roundabout answers and inevitably fall into examples of creepiness rather than an actual definition.

Of course, their examples are all over the map and seem to have absolutely no rhyme or reason to them.

(For what it’s worth, I asked a bunch of female friends this question and I got answers with examples of creepiness that spanned from “he had dainty hands” to “he grabbed me really hard on the arm for no reason,” to “putting too many smileys in text messages,” to “he looks at you in a funny way when he talks.” As is often the case, women are terrible authorities on why they like/dislike something, all they know is that they like/dislike it.)

So, at the risk of sounding like a creep, allow me throw my hat in the ring and actually give a concrete definition for the phenomenon:

_Creepiness is behaving in a way that makes a woman feel insecure sexually._

The further you get out of line with your intentions, the more distrustful she will be of your actions and words. And the more distrustful she is, the more insecure she will feel and the creepier you become. For instance, if you approach a woman and stand there and talk about the weather, but you’re staring at her rack the whole time while licking your lips, then you will come across as creepy. Your actions and words are completely out of line with your intentions and she can see that.

Even if you tell her honestly, “You have great tits,” you will be creepy. Not for lack of intention, but because she doesn’t know you and most women are not comfortable being sexual around men they don’t know. Trust takes time. She has to see that your actions line up with your intentions before she can feel comfortable exposing herself to you and making herself vulnerable.

Women have a lot more to lose from expressing their sexuality than men do. They make babies. We don’t. They get raped and/or sexually assaulted at a startlingly high rate. We don’t. They have five thousands years of sexist cultural history making them feel like a slut. We don’t.

The second you make them feel uncomfortable sexually is the second you become a creep and the second she’s finding an excuse to get away from you as fast as she can.

This is why vulnerability is so huge. When you’re vulnerable around someone you don’t know, it elicits trust in them and they will become more vulnerable toward you in return. The more vulnerable a woman is willing to be around you, the less likely you will be to creep her out.

(Caveat 1: Vulnerability is still subject to the right intentions. If you tell a girl a sob story for no other reason than to get her to feel sorry for you and sleep with you, then guess what, you’re still creepy!)

(Caveat 2: Sex can be viewed as the ultimate act of vulnerability for a woman. The more vulnerable you make yourself around her — by leading, by sharing your intentions, by being honest — the more she will trust you and become vulnerable in return. Sex is a side effect of that mutual vulnerability.)

Paradoxically, the way to interact with women in a vulnerable way and, therefore, the way to combat creepiness, is to accept that some women will find you creepy some of the time. Just as with rejection, the more you’re willing to risk it, the less it will happen.

The more comfortable you are with women finding you creepy, and the more uninhibited and vulnerable your actions and words are around women, and the more aware and respectful you are of their interests and desires, the less likely they will be to find you creepy. The more reserved and closed up you are about your intentions, the more you attempt to manipulate her and mislead her about what you want and who you are, the more you disregard her feelings and actions toward you, the more likely you are to become creepy.

Obviously, there are technical aspects of communication that affect this as well. Bad body language, strange conversation topics, uncalibrated humor, inappropriate touching — these things can all make you creepy even with the best of intentions. This is why I say that at some point you have to accept that you’re going to creep some women out and that’s OK. Because the alternative is to hide your sexuality and hope a woman comes to you — and well, we all know how well that works out.

##### Sexual Tension

Flirting is the opposite of creepiness. Flirting is expressing your sexuality in a way that makes a woman feel sexually secure.

Sometimes the sexuality of your behavior is overt, sometimes it’s subtle, sometimes it’s implied. But when done correctly, it’s accepted and appreciated by women.

If you research dating advice and pick up tips, you’ll find dozens and dozens of methods of “building attraction” with women. Some of the more popular ones include teasing, bantering, negging, cocky/funny, push/pull, qualification, statements of interest, false disqualifiers, roleplaying, leading and pacing, eliciting values, magic tricks, cold-reading, false takeaways, word games, hand games, betting and competition, etc.

Chances are, you’ve read or are familiar with at least a few of these concepts. If you don’t know what most of them are, then good, don’t worry about it. No, I’m serious — don’t worry about it, because they all follow the same basic pattern.

> Flirting is expressing your sexuality to a woman in a way that makes her feel secure expressing her sexuality back towards you.

In a nutshell, what a lot of men refer to as “game” is their ability to flirt with women. How well can they express their sexuality to women with positive responses? If they can do it often, they have “game.”

The tactics or strategies used (teasing, etc.) all do this in their own ways, but they all follow the same pattern. For the sake of time and space (and boredom), I’ll be grouping most methods of flirting into two different groups: teasing and boldness. Both teasing and bold types of flirting (whether it’s negging, false takeaways, or roleplaying) follow the same basic formula: they all involve breaking rapport in order to generate sexual tension.

Scientific research shows that sexual tension builds when the uncertainty of potential sexual possibilities is presented in an interaction. For example, if I say something with implied sexual innuendo like, “Well, that’s cool you are into cats, maybe I can come over and play with your pussy for a while,” this generates sexual tension because, assuming she doesn’t throw her drink in my face or slap me, it leaves the possibility of a future sexual encounter on the table. It’s a story with no ending, the human brain wants to know what happens next. And in this case, what happens next is probably something sexual.

Teasing type behaviors generate sexual tension because they generate uncertainty as to whether or not you’re actually interested in a woman. In the example above, depending on the context and situation, I could be totally joking and being facetious. Or I could be totally serious and masking my desires behind a thinly-veiled joke. She doesn’t know. And that’s what makes it so good. The uncertainty generates the tension.

If you tease a woman about her hair, telling her she looks like ET with a perm, or that your grandmother once owned a wig like that, you accomplish sexual tension because you are sending mixed signals. Your intentions are sending a “Yes, I like you,” signal, while your words are sending a, “No, I “don’t,” signal. This generates uncertainty and, therefore, sexual tension.

This is why most dating advice in western culture, to both men and women, encourages you to send mixed messages, “play hard to get,” or play games with one another. Sure, it distorts intentions, but it also generates uncertainty and therefore, sexual tension.

But one can flirt by being clear with one’s intentions as well. One can state one’s sexual desires clearly or actually even move to make those sexual desires happen. It’s counterintuitive, but this can generate a lot of uncertainty and sexual tension as well.

For instance, let’s say you meet a woman and just come right out and say, “I think you’re beautiful, I’d like to take you on a date.”

A lot of men cringe at this idea. Needy men hate it because they think it will make them creepy. Narcissistic men hate it because they believe they’re giving their power away.

But in reality, it’s one of the most powerful and practical things you can say. Not only is it vulnerable, as we’ve discussed at length, but it also builds far more sexual tension.

But how? If she already knows you like her, how can it build tension? There’s no uncertainty.

Oh, but there is. It’s just not immediately obvious. Observe:

1. First of all, a direct statement like that is polarizing. So if a woman is not interested in you, she will let you know then and there. If she is interested in you, this bold statement will make her so excited that you will also know then and there. Either way, you win.

2. Women are turned on by being desired, remember? They are aroused by men who perform bold behaviors towards them. So it turns her on.

3. It also demonstrates that you are not needy, which makes you more attractive to her.

4. So now we have an aroused woman who is interested, and an attractive man who is bold and vulnerable. And both have implicitly or explicitly suggested sexual interest. Suddenly this opens up all sorts of new questions and opportunities: What is going to happen next? He’s so bold and direct, I have no idea what he’ll say or do. Does he want to kiss me? Does he want to fuck me? Do I want to fuck him? I do and I don’t. I don’t know what to do. When is he going to touch me? What will it be like? Will I love it?”

See, if a man is having an innocuous conversation with a bunch of small talk, there is never any uncertainty in the woman’s mind as to where things stand. The conversation is shallow and simple and so there’s no question as to why they’re talking or the significance of what they’re talking about.

If a man begins to flirt with a woman by teasing her, then suddenly he adds a new dimension by creating uncertainty: Does he like me or not? Why is he flirting with me?

But if a man goes the bold and vulnerable route, and is willing to risk rejection, he is rewarded by creating massive amounts of sexual tension, because in a single stroke you have transported the context away from, “What do we talk about next?” to “What will he say or do with me next?

This is extremely powerful.

Of course, this is often easier said than done. Flirting this way requires showing vulnerability, risking rejection, and/or potentially being creepy. And at first, you may flirt in needy and supplicant ways, repelling women even faster than you did when you were just plain and boring. But eventually, exposing yourself and your sexual desires will force you to be less invested, more confident, more dominant, and more attractive. The teasing will help by creating the perception of non-neediness, and the boldness will make women more and more receptive to your eventual sexual advances.

But unlike fears of living an attractive lifestyle, flirting and expressing your sexuality requires communicating effectively. It requires competency at certain social behaviors. And social behaviors, like any other kind of behavior, aren’t simply picked up overnight. They must be built and honed through practice.

##### Developing an Emotional Connection

Your ability to connect with a woman emotionally is proportional to how self-aware you are of your own emotional processes and motivations.

As described in Chapter 2, self-awareness and vulnerability will cause you to behave in a less needy manner, they give her the chance to know the “real you,” to trust you, and to open her own emotions up to you.

Ultimately, this is what most women want. If you look at romance novels — basically the female version of porn — they all follow more or less the exact same pattern: hard and rugged bad-boy type male hero is troubled but strong, and as he slowly opens up and shares his true emotions and desires with the heroine, she’s able to support him, to save him and ultimately fall in love with him. Of course, they live happily ever after.

This is more or less the blueprint of seduction: a strong, high status, attractive exterior (lifestyle and looks), fearless, and able to open up and share your vulnerable side with her. Women get weak in the knees for this shit. And it’s not even conscious most of the time.

All that’s required is a certain level of emotional self-awareness and vulnerability in your interactions.

And let me tell you, emotional connections are powerful. Far more powerful than any sort of tactics or tricks you may learn in other books. When you connect with women emotionally, they really open up to you in ways that you can’t imagine, your interactions and relationships with them become these rich and unique experiences that can never be replicated, the sex is far better, and all mind games, flakes and ambivalence goes out the window.

A lot of pick up and dating advice is what I call “attraction obsessed.” It has a constant, incessant harping on being the most attractive/alpha guy possible — usually by employing all sorts of tricks, games, tactics, techniques, manipulation and other falsehoods. Attraction obsession comes from a place of insecurity. It seeks validation. It’s needy behavior and, therefore, self-sabotaging in the long run.

It's not about attraction. She's attracted to men all the time but doesn't sleep with any of them or date them. Women actually don't sleep with most men they're attracted to because they would feel slutty or cheap.

Her feeling slutty or cheap isn't about an "Oh, I put out on a first date," thing. It's not about number of dates, hours spent together, or how many dinners you bought her.

Feeling slutty is about sleeping with a man who doesn't care about her or who hasn’t connected with her. If she doesn't trust you or isn't 100% convinced that you really like her and care about her, then she's not going to do it. And if she does, then she’ll regret it and feel dirty.

So how do you develop deep and lasting emotional connections with women, connections that will blow your mind and heart away as well as hers too? Connections that will give you some of the best nights and sex of your life?

Here’s the basic pattern, and you should recognize a lot of overlap here with Chapter 2:

* Becoming aware of your own emotions, motivations, and life story.   
* Taking the lead by sharing those emotions, motivations, and life story first.  
* Sharing first creates trust and encourages her to open up and share herself in return.  
* Ideally, the more this goes on, the more personal the stories become and the deeper the emotions are by which you connect.  

And the most important rule of emotional connection is to relate to feelings, not facts. Seduction is about feelings, not facts. This is why you can often meet a woman who shares a lot in common with you — same home town, same occupation, same interests, lives on the same street — and have no connection or chemistry whatsoever. But then you can meet a woman who has lived an entirely different life from you, but if you can relate to the emotional struggles and emotional realities that she’s gone through, you can connect deeply with her.

Everybody on this planet shares a handful of universal emotional realities: ambition, shame, alienation, loneliness, achievement, regret, hardship, friendship, love, heartbreak. We’ve all experienced it. The facts change, the feelings are the same. I don’t care how shallow or dumb or weird or annoying she is, she has it somewhere in her. It’s your job to dig it out and connect with it. That’s where the gold is. That’s where the real magic happens. Challenge yourself to find it. Because once you do, you’ll never go back.

And the biggest misconception about generating a strong emotional connection is that it obligates you to some sort of commitment. It doesn’t. Although it’s more likely to cause you two to want to commit to one another, a relationship commitment is an intellectual construct, emotional connection happens organically on an unconscious level.

# Chapter 12

##### How to Improve Your Flirting


Sometimes, even if your intentions are in line and you’re expressing yourself openly, people won’t always necessarily perceive you correctly. Communication is always up for interpretation; therefore, there’s always going to be a chance that you’ll be misunderstood or people might make incorrect judgments about you. There’s also a good chance that you aren’t expressing yourself clearly or effectively.

For instance, you may ask a girl out for coffee. But perhaps she’s inexperienced or comes from a conservative background, and so what is a clear statement of interest from you, appears to her as just an invitation for friendship.

Or maybe you compliment a woman on her dress. But for whatever reason, your tonality, and facial expression aren’t clear and she thinks you’re being sarcastic. Maybe she’s insecure and very touchy about men complimenting her, so she responds negatively.

In the long run, misunderstandings and miscommunications are unavoidable. No matter how clear and how charming you are there are always going to be women who misinterpret what you say to them as well as your intentions. This is a fact of life and something you have to get used to.

But what we can control is how efficiently and openly we communicate by learning clear and effective communication skills. The better our communication skills, the more clearly we can express ourselves and show sexual interest. The more clearly we express ourselves and show sexual interest, the more likely we’ll be able to connect with women in a sexual and emotional way.

It’s sad but true. There are often situations where a woman will be sexually interested in a man, but their failure to communicate their intentions to one another clearly will derail the entire interaction. There’s no excuse to let this happen.

And as with all of the Three Fundamentals, you’ll find that clear communication will enhance other areas of your life — your professional relationships, your family relationships, your friendships, your networking abilities — just as much as it enhances your romantic relationships and your ability to meet and attract women.

##### First Impressions

First impressions are crucial. Studies show that we base the majority of our perception of people on the first few minutes we spend with them. This initial perception can extend and influence our relationship to the person for weeks or even months.

If I look at all of the women I’ve dated seriously, just about all of them (I’d estimate 90% or so), it felt “on” within the first few minutes of the interaction. We clicked and that first impression led to a romantic and sexual relationship further down the line.

The biggest misconception about first impressions is being overly concerned with what to say to a woman when you meet her. What you say to her when you first meet her is actually unimportant, and hopefully by this point in the book, I don’t have to explain why.

> The exact words you say are far less important than your intentions and level of anxiety.

Ninety percent of the time when I meet a new woman, I simply say, “Hi, I’m Mark.” I then follow it up with, “I wanted to meet you.” And if I’m feeling particularly bold, I’ll say, “I thought you were cute and wanted to meet you.”
That’s it.

You can ask a woman how her day is going, or say the most perceptive and witty thing to her in the first minutes, but her first impression is largely going to be based on how you present yourself (looks/lifestyle; Chapters 7 and 8), your level of anxiety (anxiety; Chapters 9 and 10), and your ability to communicate clearly. What actually comes out of your mouth is going to be forgotten or completely irrelevant within seconds.

With that in mind, here are guidelines for making a good first impression: Do not startle or scare her when you approach her. This is possibly the only death knell for approaching women. If you startle her or scare her when she first meets you, in my experience, there is almost absolutely nothing you can do to recover. You’re immediately labeled “creepy” and she will do anything possible to get out of the situation. Even if she’s polite and talks for a minute, chances are she’s never going to open up and trust you.

Typical ways guys startle or scare women upon the approach are by approaching them from behind (huge no-no), grabbing them violently, screaming at them, or saying something offensive or weird.

When in doubt on how to approach a woman, simply walk up and introduce yourself and explain to her that you wanted to meet her. I know this sounds drab and boring. But remember, it’s not about entertaining her; it’s about being non-needy and expressing your genuine interest in her. During the day, I often preface the introduction by saying something like, “Excuse me, this is kind of random...” Also during the day, I usually tell them that I think they’re cute.

In my experience, the fancier and more creative guys try to get with their opening lines, the more likely they are to a) say something weird and b) come off as needy. Think about it, if you sit around for 10 minutes trying to think of what to say to a girl so that she’ll like you, how is that ever not needy?

She’ll sense this. In fact, it’s kind of amazing. Women really do seem to have a sixth sense about this stuff. I’ve noticed that the longer I hesitate and stare at a girl before I approach her, the more likely I am to be rejected. The best approaches I ever do are when I don’t think about it and I spontaneously just walk up and say hello.

Don’t linger. If you linger and hover around her, it’s almost guaranteed to make the approach feel awkward and forced. Imagine a straight line between you and her, and when you’re ready to go, follow that straight line until you’re standing right in front of her. Don’t stand around and kick the dirt at your feet trying to work up the nerve right next to her.

Smile. Always smile. Don’t smile like the Joker from the Batman movies smiles. But smile like you’re a nice, friendly person. A comfortable smile. Lean back. Stand up tall. Speak loudly yet clearly. Make strong eye contact. Introduce yourself and stick out your hand. Give a firm handshake. This is called being a confident human being.

If you are getting many rejections right on the initial approach, then it’s one of the following three things:

1. You’re presenting yourself poorly — i.e., you dress poorly, bad looks, bad style, bad body language.  
2. Your intentions are off. You’re approaching for the wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include anything that is not, “She’s cute. I want to meet her.” That means, approaching for statistics, approaching for "practice,” approaching to impress your friends. Approaching because you want to live up to a bunch of crap you read on the internet. These are all the wrong reasons to approach. When you see a beautiful woman, you should be motivated by nothing but your desire to get to know her. That’s it. If you have trouble finding that motivation, refer back to the section on sexual anxiety in Chapter 9.
3. You’re not following one of the guidelines above. You’re startling her. You’re trying too hard to be clever or interesting. Or you’re doing something technically wrong (not looking her in the eye, not smiling, etc.)

And really that’s all the opener is trying to do: stop them and get them to talk to you for a second. It’s your conversation skills that get that second to turn into a minute and that minute to turn into an hour.

##### Conversation Skills

Developing conversation skills is a deep topic, and for the sake of this book, I’m only going to gloss over the most important aspects and the advice that’s easiest to implement.

The topics that we’ll cover in this section are:

* Using effective language  
* Questions versus statements  
* Creating endless conversation topics  
* Storytelling  
* Basics of emotional connection

__Using Effective Language: This is the easiest “quick fix” that you can apply to your communication skills. Using effective language means saying what you mean with the fewest words possible while still maintaining your meaning and intent.__

This is where being a good writer can actually help you become a good communicator. If you’re saying something in four sentences that could be said in one, say it in one. If you are saying something in ten words that can be said in four, say it in four.

In conversation and communication quality always wins out over quantity. We would all rather have 30 seconds of amazing communication than 10 minutes of mediocre communication saying the same thing.

__Questions versus Statements: Creating threads of conversation through statement is far more powerful than questions. This is because it assumes rapport and instantly makes conversations more personally.__

For instance, if you’ve been talking to a woman at a bar for a few minutes, saying, “I love olives in my drink. When I was a kid I used to eat them straight out of the jar,” is far more interesting than, “Do you like olives in your drink?” and waiting for her response. In fact, that question is just plain weird. But that statement is interesting, and what many women would consider “cute.”

Instead of incessant questioning, you want to develop a skill called cold reading. Cold reading is a skill where you’re able to intuitively “know” something about someone else without actually knowing it.

It’s like being a psychic without the cheesiness.

For our purposes, cold reading is just a way of creating interesting statements rather than asking questions for information. You don’t ask the question you want to know, but instead, you make a mild prediction.

Instead of asking her a question about herself, you guess the answer to your question and then state it. Here are some examples:

“Where are you from?” translates to: “You look like a California girl.”  
“What do you do for work?” translates to: “You seem to be a creative person. I bet your job is interesting."  
“How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys look like you’ve been friends for a long time.”  

In each situation, the statement makes an educated guess and engages the woman far more than any question will. Instead of asking her about herself, you’re telling her about herself. The only thing people love more than talking about themselves is hearing about themselves. But what if you’re wrong?

That’s the best part! A lot of guys worry about cold reading because they’re afraid to state something incorrect. This is where human nature works in our favor.

There’s no failing with cold reading. With every cold read, one of three things will happen:

1. You’ll be wrong, and she’ll correct you.  
2. You’ll be wrong, and she’ll ask you what made you think that.  
3. You’ll be right, and she’ll freak out at how perceptive you are.  

In the first result, she’ll basically just answer the question you based your cold read on and forget that you were wrong.

In the second result, you’ll be wrong, but she’ll be so intrigued by your guess, that she’ll create a deeper conversation thread about what you observed about her. Later in the chapter, we’ll talk about the importance of creating the deepest threads possible.

In the third result, the few times you get the cold read correct, she will most likely be surprised at how perceptive you are about her. This will generate a tidal wave of rapport immediately and impress her at the same time.

You should cold read as much as possible. Any time you’re asking a question that requires a factual answer, take a stab at the answer instead of asking.

Besides that, creating conversations out of statements protects you from what I call “blanking.” You know when you are talking to a woman and all the sudden the conversation dies and you have no idea what to say? You’re sitting there awkwardly and the more uncomfortable you feel, the harder it is to come up with something. Eventually, you blurt out something boring like, “So… where do you live?”

Using statements can prevent this a great deal. Instead of fishing for a new conversation based on a generic question, you can simply comment about something or observe something. Never underestimate the power of non-sequiturs.

These will sometimes come across as random. But that’s because they are — they’re whatever thoughts are popping into your head at the moment. It’s better to be random and interesting than predictable and boring. Don’t be afraid to just blurt something out.

This works because unlike questions, statements require no investment from the other person. You can say whatever you want and there’s no implicit expectation for her to generate conversation as well.

Speaking in statements in this fashion — to generate spontaneous conversation — is important in that it forces you to share yourself with her. When you simply ask a girl questions, you aren’t giving any information about yourself, so it’s harder for her to trust you or build rapport. But if you simply state a fact about yourself and then talk about it, you are now sharing yourself and giving her a chance to chime in with her input as well.

The amazing thing about speaking in statements is if you do it correctly, she will start asking you questions. This may not seem like a big deal, but it actually reorients the entire interaction. As I mentioned earlier, whoever is asking the questions is sub-communicating a desire to learn more about the other, i.e., interest, i.e., they’re attracted to them. If she is constantly seeking information from you, you now have the power to control the interaction — you control the information and the conversation.

__Endless Conversation Topics:__ “In every topic of conversation, there are countless opportunities to jump off onto other topics — there are countless word associations to be made.

For instance, let’s assume you’re talking to a woman and she says, “I never liked that restaurant. I went there on my birthday last year, and I don’t remember anything past midnight. I woke up on my friend’s kitchen floor.”

This is loaded with opportunities to take the conversation in new directions. You could relate and talk about any of the following:

1. The restaurant she doesn’t like.  
2. What you did on your last birthday.  
3. The last time you got black out drunk.  
4. A story about waking up somewhere unusual.  

Any and all of these topics will be relevant and interesting to the conversation.

If you don’t already do this, it’s a habit you need to ingrain in yourself — just as the comedians ingrain off-the-wall word associations.

__Storytelling:__ Human beings, by default, are enrapt by stories, or more specifically, a story arc. Politicians use them to campaign, teachers use them to explain important concepts, comedians use them to make us laugh, and we use them constantly in our day-to-day interactions.

But what you probably didn’t notice is that the best communicators you know are fantastic storytellers.

Have you ever had a friend who would start telling you about something and it just seemed to go nowhere? Like, they’d start telling you about their trip to Chicago and after describing the hotel and maybe mentioning the concierge, the story just died?

Or have you ever known someone who consistently makes jokes that don’t completely make sense, or fizzle out and aren’t funny?

Or maybe you’re one of these people. Do people ever stop paying attention to you mid-story? Or do you have trouble making others laugh (intentionally, that is)?

Chances are, these people (or you), aren’t following a strong story arc. For whatever reason, humans have evolved to be absolutely fascinated when information is communicated in a certain pattern. This is true of just about any culture and background.

There are three main points of a story arc:

Set Up: The set up is exactly that: you’re setting the scene or the context for what you’re about to say. It’s the foundation of what’s about to be told, and if you don’t set up properly, then your stories, jokes, and ideas will always seem to be random. People will consistently comment that you’re really random, weird, or “off the wall.”

Content/Conflict: After setting up what you’re going to talk about, you get into the actual content. This can also be the “conflict” in your story. Whatever it is, it’s something that causes tension and expectancy. The content of your story needs to be intriguing and hook people into wanting to know what will happen next. If you don’t build much tension with the content of your stories, you will find people losing interest or get the feeling like you ramble on a lot.

Resolution: The resolution releases the tension from the conflict or content. Resolutions can come in forms of punchlines (for jokes), conclusions (for ideas), or just closure for a generic story. People who don’t resolve their stories and ideas well will often get blank stares when they’re finished speaking, or people asking them, “Yeah, and…?” not realizing that the story is finished.

In real life, people speak in more than sentences; they speak to each other in stories. So you’ll want to develop the ability to formulate entire stories around jump off points, as well as notice jump off points within entire stories.
This is actually much easier than it sounds, and you probably do it naturally with your friends and family in a lot of situations. The idea is to just do it consistently and naturally and with anybody, including attractive women.

Relating and Connecting: The final goal of a successful conversation is to actually make a personal connection with the woman you’re talking to.

When you are talking to a woman, there are only two real subjects of conversation: her and you. Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you.

This uncovering of identity is what creates the sense of a “connection.” The greater the connection you create, the more she’ll want to spend time with you and vice-versa.

Making a connection requires three steps: 

1) being open about yourself,    
2) getting her to be open about herself, and   
3) relating to each other’s experiences.”  

Most men feel a bit vulnerable when talking about these topics, especially to women. That’s the point.

Be willing to share any part of yourself to anyone at any time and on any level. You have nothing to lose by sharing yourself. At the worst, she’ll reject you and, well, she’s going to reject you if all you do is talk about sports and your job anyway, so what’s the problem?

What you’ll actually find is when you share something deeper and personal about yourself, it will be genuine and she’ll immediately respond to that by being genuine herself.

Ideally, sharing these aspects of yourself will encourage her to share them in herself. You want to get her to talk about her passions, her ambitions, her best experiences and her most vulnerable experiences. These are the topics that define us as humans and make us unique — that is, different from the last 20 guys who talked to her.

These are the topics of conversation that will make you stand out. Why? Because she knows you. Not your favorite sports team. Not the party you went to last week, but you.

And when she knows you and remembers you, she’ll make sure to pick up the phone when you call and meet up with you again.

In conclusion: When it comes to conversations, there’s a lot to cover. Reading this last section may have been overwhelming for you. If so, just remember: break it up into little chunks, practice one thing at a time.

##### Humor

There’s an old saying, if you can make a woman laugh then you can get her to laugh right into bed. Now, although humor is not a cure-all for anybody’s dating problems, it’s definitely important. In fact, in many surveys of what women look for most in a man, “sense of humor” is almost always at the top of that list.

The reason is that a strong sense of humor conveys all of the attractive traits of your identity to a woman. A man who can laugh easily at the world and who isn’t afraid to laugh at himself conveys a sense of non-neediness. He also makes women feel good around him and, therefore, more secure. A man who is very serious and unable to laugh at himself or the world conveys that he is heavily invested in the perceptions of the world around him and is therefore needy.

Your specific type of sense of humor isn’t so important as much as that you have it. Obviously, different women will respond strongly to different types of humor, but this is less a function of your ability to tell jokes and more a function of demographics. Sarcastic women will like sarcastic men. Silly women will like silly men, and so on. Focus on what you find funny to you personally, and don’t be afraid to share that with the women you meet. If they laugh, then great! If they don’t, then chances are it wasn’t going to work anyway.

At its core, humor is the art of drawing connections between two seemingly unrelated ideas or objects. There are a number of ways to do this, but at its core, humor is a creative activity and, therefore, will greatly be tied to your ability to uninhibitedly express yourself.

Sometimes your jokes will fall flat, particularly when you’re starting out. That’s OK. Don’t laugh at yourself. Don’t make fun of yourself. Don’t try to explain the joke. These are all needy responses that are dependent on others’ perceptions of yourself rather than your own. Sometimes jokes are bad or unfunny. That’s fine. Just move on.

In this section, I’ll give a brief overview of a few types of humor: misdirection, exaggeration, sarcasm, wordplay, and roleplaying.

* Misdirection: One of the most common and easiest forms of humor is misdirection. Misdirection occurs when you begin to say something or tell a story that leads the listener to believe you’re making one point, and then out of nowhere you say something completely different. 

* Exaggeration: Exaggeration is another mainstay of humor and something that everyone should be able to use. Exaggeration is when you take a quality about something, and blow it completely out of proportion, often in a creative or interesting way. Typically, the more creative and extreme you are in describing your exaggeration, the funnier it will be. 

* Teasing and Sarcasm: Whereas misdirection and exaggeration are funny to just about anybody, you’ll run into a minority of women who don’t find teasing or sarcasm funny. Teasing and sarcasm can also vary in degrees of appropriateness, especially depending on where you are. If you’re at a funeral, it’s probably not a good idea to make sarcastic comments about the deceased’s family. Teasing is when you make humorous comments that are derogatory about someone. Generally, teasing is done in good humor and with good intentions. Teasing with bad intentions becomes insulting and is not welcome by most people.
Teasing is supposed to be fun. The ideal tease will create a mixture of emotions in a girl: defensiveness yet happiness. The ideal reaction is when a girl will say, “Oh my god, I can’t believe you said that,” but will be laughing at the same time and smiling. Be careful with teases, especially to women you don’t know. Teasing polarizes, often hard and quickly. Therefore, it’s a good tactic, but not always exactly pleasant.

* The Role of Swearing: Swearing and dirty language has an interesting role in humor. Many types of humor, such as sarcasm and exaggeration require a certain level of edginess to pack a powerful punch. Using dirty language or swear words is kind of a cheap and easy way to make whatever you say more extreme. For instance, adding the word “fucking” into just about any humorous statement will make it pack a little more of a punch. At the same time, using swear words is kind of a shortcut, and if you use them too often, they’ll get old quickly and sound try-hard. Dropping a well-timed F-bomb can make a funny joke even funnier. But dropping an F-bomb into everything you say just makes you look unsophisticated.Generally, the older you are, the more I recommend avoiding dirty language. Use it sparingly and only use it when you have a specific reason to. The more you use it, the more attention-seeking and negative you will make yourself appear, both of which are unattractive traits.

* Wordplay and Puns: Wordplay is similar to misdirection in that the listener expects one type of meaning and gets another, but wordplay practices misdirection by using words that have various meanings.

* Roleplaying and Games: Games and roleplaying are quick and easy ways to inject fun into any interaction with a woman. They’re playful. And they open up plenty of opportunities for other types of humor when you use them.

Also, beware of falling into the trap of self-deprecating humor. A lot of men, particularly needy men who are highly invested in other people’s reactions around them, will make fun of themselves and put themselves down in order to get a laugh.

Although this may make women laugh, when used in excess, it’s a needy behavior because you’re sacrificing your own self-perception for the sake of others’ amusement. Therefore, it’s ultimately unattractive. Guys with a good sense of humor who habitually use it on themselves, I recommend turning those same jokes and thoughts onto the women you’re talking to. Instead of making fun of yourself, make fun of her. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but you’ll be surprised at how it will blow your interactions wide open and infuse more sexuality and playfulness into them.

Humor is not a cure-all for your problems with attracting and seducing women (if there were a cure-all, it’d be physicality; Chapter 14). Some naturally funny men overly rely on their ability to make a girl laugh and actually overdo it. Instead of being attractive and strong men, they become entertainers constantly seeking attention and validation. The worst part about this habit is that it all happens while making the woman laugh and making her enjoy your company. So a lot of men get confused and actually think that they’re seducing her. She’s smiling. She’s laughing. She likes me. She must be sexually attracted to me, right?

Sadly, no. Humor is only useful if used in conjunction with leading her in a dominant manner and pushing things physically with her. Ultimately, you aren’t ever really attracting a woman unless you’re connecting with her physically and emotionally. And although humor is a very useful tool to help you do that, it doesn’t actually do it for you.

##### The Dating Process

Like it or not, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid line. Boy meets girl, asks girl on date, corresponds with girl, sets up date with girl, corresponds with girl, sets up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home with you, and at some point you decide if you’re exclusive, non-exclusive, a casual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever again.

There are exceptions to this process, and the process can be sped up to a degree, but more or less, there’s a courtship process that we all follow. Our culture has silently defined a procedure for these things, and any man who wishes to be successful with women needs to be aware of the procedure.

The process almost always involves the following: trading of contact details, talking through text or phone conversations, going on dates, sex, and figuring out what kind of relationship (if any) will result. Usually (but not always) in that order. In certain instances, the contact details and date can be forgone and you can bring her home (or go home with her) the day/night you meet her. But these cases are rare and usually involve meeting a woman in a party or nightclub situation which we won’t get into a whole lot of depth about.

##### Phone Numbers

There’s a minor obsession in men’s dating advice about phone numbers, correspondence, and so-called “text game” or “flake prevention.”

Flaking is a term often used to describe a woman who gives you her phone number, says she wants to see you again, and then either never responds or returns your call, or never shows up on a date. Flakes can simply be women who never respond to you or women who respond but keep sidestepping meeting up with you.

Obsessing about flakes and how to win them over is an easy trap to fall into. But in my opinion, this is treating the symptom, not the illness.

The way to prevent flakes is to meet and attract women who are so interested in you that they would never consider flaking.

Problem solved.

In my experience, 99% of the so-called flake prevention strategies guys implement — calling at certain times, baiting with open-ended texts, pretending to send a text to the “wrong person” — these will rarely convince a girl who was never attracted to you to suddenly become attracted to you. And even if by some chance they do convince her to meet up with you, you’re now on a date with a woman who has no genuine interest being there with you.

Similarly, men spend way too much time obsessing over unimportant details like how many times to text each day, how soon to call her, when to ask her out, etc. Setting rigid rules such as “wait three days to ask her out” or “never text her twice in a row,” greatly limits you and will hinder the unique connection you spent your time developing with the woman. And by the way, it’s that connection that’s going to get her out to see you again, not the clever text you spent 45 minutes coming up with.

But with that said, here is my version of “The Rules” to calling and texting women:

* Only ask a woman for her phone number if she seems genuinely attracted and interested in you. Only ask for her number if you can see yourself wanting to hang out with her again or having time to hang out with her again. If you meet a girl who is in town for a bachelorette party for three days, is drunk, and you have a serious meeting at work in two days, don’t bother.

* When you ask her for her phone number, don’t come up with a fancy line or make up a reason. Just ask her for it. If you’re attracted to her, you shouldn’t be afraid to hide it (you’re a confident, dominant man, remember?). If she’s attracted to you, she’ll be more than excited to give it to you. Most women will always give you their number when you ask. Even if they don’t like you or have no intention of ever seeing you again, they’ll give it to you. It’s simply far easier for them to ignore calls from guys they don’t like than to reject every guy to their face.

* Flakes happen to everybody. Get used to it. There are simply too many things going on in most attractive women’s lives to figure out why each one flakes. It could be because her ex-boyfriend started calling her again. It could be because she met her soul mate the day after she met you. It could be because she got in a freak accident and is in the hospital. It could be because she got sick and was bed-ridden. Sometimes women just don’t feel like dating for a while. Sometimes they don’t remember you well because they were drunk when they met you. Sometimes they lose their phone. Sometimes they just change their mind the next day. And sometimes they just don’t care enough.

There are a million legitimate reasons women can flake other than then not being attracted to you. Trying to figure out which ones are flaking for legitimate reasons and which ones are not is more or less an impossible task. You’re better off just letting it go and moving on. In the end, it comes down to the fact that if she likes you enough, she’ll find a way to make it happen. If she’s not finding a way to make it happen, then she probably doesn’t like you as much as you thought she did.


Think of it this way. If Brad Pitt texted her asking her out, do you think she could suddenly clear her busy work schedule and move her weekend plans back? I think so. If she’s not doing that for you, then she’s just not that interested.

My policy with flakes is “Three strikes you’re out.” If a woman flakes once, I’ll try her a second time. If she doesn’t respond the second time, I may or may not give it a third shot, but typically if I do, I don’t put much effort into the third attempt. Often I will only try a woman once or twice. If there’s still nothing after the third attempt, I move on.

A lot of women will give you excuses why they can’t meet up, cancel dates, push dates back, or simply stop responding. Sometimes they have legitimate reasons. Sometimes they’re making excuses. This is why at the first reason they give, I always give them the benefit of the doubt and try again. The second time, if I’m particularly interested in them and/or I think they genuinely have had two legitimate excuses, I will try them one more time. Often I will even tell them, “OK, last chance though.” After the third try, I just let them go. It’s not worth the time or effort at that point.

I always text within 24 hours of getting her number. I send a simple text: “Hey Sara, it was nice meeting you.” That’s it. Most girls who are interested in you will respond somewhat quickly. The ones who do not respond to this will usually flake on you.

From there, I usually wait another day or so and start a text conversation. I like to reference a conversation we had when we met in this text to try and keep some continuity. The goal here is nothing special, just trying to get a little bit of back and forth going. It’s been over 24 hours and I’m seeing how warm the lead still is. 

Typically, if I can get a text conversation going here, then she’s pretty likely to go on a date with me. If her responses are few and far between, then she’s likely a flake.


Don’t get fancy and try to re-invent the wheel here. Don’t get cute or try to win her over if she’s not responding very much. Your legwork was put in when you met her, now you’re stuck with what you earned. I’ve found that the cuter or harder you try to win girls over by text, the bigger chance you have of looking needy and desperate and losing them.

Joke and tease her if she’s being responsive. If she’s not, stick to trying to get her out ASAP.

Depending how the text conversation goes, I’ll either ask her out right then and there, or I’ll wait another day or two depending on my schedule. It used to be expected that you call women, but texting has quickly overtaken phone calls. Back in 2005 when I started this stuff, I called every number I got. Now I almost never call a girl unless she specifically asks that I call her. I would say in the last year, over 90% of my dates have been set up through texting.

I have to say this again: don’t get fancy or cute in your texts. Texting is, in general, an awful medium for communication. Often if you try to get too sarcastic or witty in your texts, they can be easily misinterpreted or come off with a completely different intention than you originally had. And remember, everything comes back to intention. So clear, blunt language. I tell guys that I only use texting to organize when she and I are going to see each other next. Literally, that’s what 90% of my texts consist of, things like, “Hey, what are you doing Thursday night?” or “I’m busy this weekend, but I want to see you again.”

A flake is a flake. No matter what you do. Even if you can create a temporary illusion that she wants to meet up with you.
If anything, being cute and trying to impress her will only hurt you, as it will come across as needy and unattractive. One of the quickest ways to lose a girl is by texting her stuff that’s way too try-hard.

When in doubt, be plain and to-the-point.

This often disappoints some guys. They get really excited about sending fancy or brilliant texts that magically change a girl’s mind on a dime. Don’t bother. Short of lying or manipulation, it almost never works.

##### The Perfect Date

Despite how nervous you get beforehand, dates are perhaps the most straightforward part of this entire process. Go to the right venues, go at the right times, avoid the obvious pitfalls, and you should be in the clear.

When to Go on Dates: Don’t do lunch dates, and never make an afternoon date the first date if possible. Just don’t do it. For whatever reason, nothing says, “let’s just be friends” more than having lunch together.

Save dates for the nighttime. It builds a greater sense of expectation. There’s more flexibility to spend more time together. It’s more of a commitment. And neither of you are in a rush to be anywhere in an hour. It also leaves the option open for you or her sleeping over.

As far as when to go, it’s going to depend a lot on what you’re doing. But you want to allow yourself time for at least three one-hour activities (more on that later). So anywhere between 6 PM to 9 PM. Later than that, and you limit your time together. Earlier than that, and you get a daytime vibe and the date will usually run out of steam before she has to go home. You want to time the date so that you are peaking together at around 10 PM or 11 PM and she has the, “I need to go home, but I don’t want to yet,” feeling.

Where to Go: Absolutely no movie dates for first or second dates. Movie dates are terrible. You don’t get to talk, you sit awkwardly next to each other, and it’s impossible to touch her without being awkward.

Avoid dinner dates if at all possible. They’re cliché. They can be somewhat impersonal depending on where you eat. Once again, it’s almost impossible to touch. And believe it or not, a lot of women are self-conscious about eating in front of you, food selection, etc. Also, you can avoid the awkward “who pays?” situation — which we’ll talk about in the next section.

Good date locations are locations that are active, participatory, and allow for touching and flirting. Alcohol can be helpful as well if that’s your style. Some good examples include comedy clubs, dance classes, museum exhibits, walks in interesting places (plazas, parks, etc.), concerts, or just grabbing a drink somewhere.

A lot of places to go will depend on your town. I recommend using Yelp.com to find interesting places around you. For instance, there used to be a bowling alley/nightclub venue near my old apartment in Boston. It was a lot of fun. You could bowl together (participatory, active, allows flirting) as well as have a few drinks, and if things went well and we were in a party mood, we could go downstairs and dance.

Bars and nightclubs are fine if you both are into those kinds of venues. Just make sure that if you go, you end up there alone. A date with friends is not a date. This will often happen if she suggests a bar to go — “Oh, we can meet my friend Cindy there…” Chances are if she wants to hang out with her friend with you, then it’s no longer a date.

Finally, you should find venues and activities that are close to either your place or her place. What I recommend doing is researching and finding at least 4-6 good date venues or activities that are within a short drive of your house or apartment. Even better is if you can find a few places that are within walking distance.

The logic is simple: the closer the venues are to your place or hers, the less travel time necessary, the fewer logistical headaches, and the better the chance of you ending up at each other’s houses at the end of the night.

Once you’ve researched and found 4-6 venues and activities near your place that you enjoy doing, that are good date activities and are easily accessible, it’s time to start putting them together and do multiple things on each date.

This may sound weird to you, but this is key. Most men do dinner and then sit at the table for another hour chatting away. There’s little flirting. No activity. No touching. No sense of dynamics or change.

On our dates, we are doing things — lots of things. We’re going bowling, having drinks, dancing, checking out statues in the park and carriage riding — all in three hours.

There’s something strange in human psychology. Our level of intimacy with one another doesn’t just come from how much we talk about as much as it comes from the experiences we share. These dates are designed to create as much mutual experience as possible in the least amount of time possible. Here are some examples of solid dates:

* Meet for coffee   
* get ice cream down the street   
* check out the big swing in the park   
* shopping together at quirky bookstore  
* Salsa class   
* drinks next door afterward   
* walk to neighborhood pizza place   
* video games at your place  
* Window shopping at local shopping center   
* improv comedy show   
* quick dinner afterward   
* walk around local park  

Include dancing if at all possible, as it’s the most sexual date activity you can have. Also, if you two decide to drink, try to drink at the second or last venues/activities. You don't ever want to end up hammered on a date.

How to Behave on a Date: As I mentioned before, you want your dates to be interactive. You want to be able to walk around, be able to touch and be as interactive as possible.

The underlying concept to have on a date is that you should try to constantly be leading.

Every decision should be yours and she should be expected to follow it. Remove, “What do you want to do now?” from your dating vocabulary. Never say it again.

It should be like this: “Hey, let’s grab some tacos, I know a cool stand over here,” “I got an idea, I’m going to kick your ass in air hockey,” “Let’s check out the Science museum, they have an awesome exhibit on the human body,” etc.

As far as what to talk about, your conversations should be getting deeper and more personal. There should be less teasing and playful banter and more conversations about your lives and what’s important to you. Learn about her past, her passions, her dreams, what her favorite things are.

At the same time, you don’t want to turn this into a job interview (which too many dinner dates turn into), but elicit these topics by sharing them yourself.

Finally, the big question in our post-feminism world: who pays? These days, most women will offer to pay out of politeness, but you’re supposed to turn them down because it’s the gentleman thing to do (or something like that). Look, I didn’t make this stuff up, but after being on probably 100+ dates with dozens of women, and getting into more than a few awkward situations about paying, this is what works for me: pay unless she physically pulls out her wallet/credit card and stops you. Until she physically does that, just pay.

Yes, once in a while you can get women buying you drinks and stuff — there are even ways to influence them to do this — but at the end of the day, unless you’re broke, take care of them. It’s a no-lose move and it will win you points with many of them.

# Chapter 14

##### Physicality and Sex

One new conclusion in arousal research these days is that female arousal is somewhat narcissistic in nature. Women are turned on by being wanted, by being desired.

My experience supports this as well. Those in the men’s dating advice industry have discovered over the past five years or so that the more assertively you pursue a woman, the more aroused she becomes. There’s something almost “magical” about an uninhibited physicality when being with a woman.

Something as simple as taking a guy who usually stands there blabbering for hours about meteorology or something, if you take that same guy and have him put his arm around the woman he’s talking to or have him lightly touch her as if punctuating his points and jokes, this generates way more sexual tension.

Indeed, sexuality, in the end, is all about movement and our bodies entwining themselves. Everything else is kind of just a means to reach that point.

I’m going to say this point-blank: getting physical with women, and getting physical quickly and comfortably, is ultimately the difference between having a lot of female friends, and having a lot of girlfriends and dates.

Being physical with women is by far the most integral piece of seduction and dating women. If you have it, you will constantly have options. If you don’t, you will spend a lot of time alone.

I have a friend. He’s a decent-looking guy. He almost never approaches (except when he’s drunk). He’s awkward to talk to. He has a strange sense of humor. But he gets physical with women. He touches them early. He touches them often. And even if they don’t reciprocate or move away. He tries again. In other words, he’s always going for it.

And you know what? He gets laid constantly. With hot women too.

It’s amazing. I used to hang out with him and would watch him awkwardly stumble around conversations, drink a little too much, and awkwardly putting his arm around girls as the girls sat there with a look of confusion. I’d watch him and think to myself, “Oh man, what a disaster.”

And then I’d come back 20 minutes later and he’d be making out with her. And then an hour later she’d be excitedly going home with him.

He just has no inhibitions whatsoever about going for it. Unless the girl would clearly stop him or say “No!” he would always be going for it. And the women loved it. They loved his physicality and his raw sexual energy. It made them feel beautiful and sexy and it was exciting.

(Ethical note here: if a woman clearly tells you to stop doing something, stop. Don’t take offense, but instead, ask her if she’s uncomfortable and/or why she’s uncomfortable. Often it’s not that she doesn’t like you, it’s just that you’re moving too fast for her. Always respect her boundaries and clarify as early as possible what she’s comfortable with and what her expectations are. Not only is this the vulnerable thing to do, it’s also the respectful thing to do.)

Being physical with women is a necessary habit that most men who are poor with women never do. Most men are a bit shy and hesitant when it comes to “making moves:” touching, the first kiss, sexual touching, etc. Well, that needs to stop. From now on, you are a sexually assertive and dominant guy and you have no shame about it. We’ll also discover that women actually prefer you to be this way.

There are two reasons for being physically assertive with women. The first is polarization. You want to establish whether she’s sexually interested in you as soon as you possibly can. The second reason is that being physical is bold and, therefore, a highly attractive form of flirting.

Studies have shown that people being touched by somebody when they first meet them not only have a much higher probability of thinking favorably of them, but they also were shown to trust them quicker.

So how do you touch a girl right off the bat?

As you having a conversation with her, assuming she is Receptive, just lightly touch her on the arm, near the elbow. Don’t press hard or hold it, as that could startle her, but just a small brush or tap or light squeeze. Use your touching to punctuate the conversation, as if emphasizing a funny moment or the punchline of the joke. Think of touching as the exclamation marks or question marks of the dialogue.

For instance, let’s say you make a clever joke and she begins to laugh really hard, you should put your hand on her arm to punctuate the emotion of the moment.

The best way to touch is to integrate physicality into your conversation. For example, using games such as thumb wars, twirling her like a ballerina, or giving high fives are great ways to initiate physical contact. As the conversation goes on, the better things are going, the more you want to be touching and the more personal you want your touches to be.

Your touching should happen in a progression. In general, you want to start on the outside of her body — her arms and legs — and slowly move closer into her body. Put your hand on her back as you move her to sit down with you, put your arm around her lower back as she leans against the bar next to you, etc. Later on, this progression will continue into intimacy: tickling, massages, and cuddling (or spooning). And from there it will continue on into kissing, petting, and becoming sexual.

##### Signals Women Give

Men are notoriously bad at recognizing “signals” women give them when they’re interested. In the courtship process, it’s always the man’s responsibility to take action and make the moves, and the woman’s responsibility to give him signals, telling him when to proceed and when to stop.

Throughout this chapter, we will be discussing physically escalating with a woman. This involves touching her in sexual ways.

As men, we’re kind of stuck in a weird place. Because on the one hand, we’re always expected to initiate and make the first move. But on the other, we’re supposed to respect a woman’s desires and right to her own body.

This is why before proceeding with advice about getting sexual with women, I want to take a moment to list out the signals women give that indicate she is sexually interested in you. You should see these somewhat as invitations to proceed with them physically, although due to potential miscommunication, don’t make too many assumptions. What we’re looking for is a consistent stream of signals coming from her to you. Pre-approach signals mean she wants to talk to you. Conversational signals mean she wants to get closer to you physically. And escalation signals mean that she wants to get sexual with you.

View these signals as green lights when they come up, but only to move to the next group of signals (i.e., just because a woman makes eye contact with you doesn’t mean she wants to fuck you right then and there, it just means she’s curious about talking to you.) Take it one step at a time, and remember, she always has the right to back out or change her mind at any moment.

##### Pre-Approach Signals

Non-Accidental Eye Contact: When in doubt, assume it’s not accidental. Humans are programmed to look at and focus on whatever they’re either curious about or what they find attractive. If she’s looking at you even 10% more than the average stranger, then she’s at least somewhat curious/interested in you. I make a point to approach every woman who makes non-accidental eye contact with me, and it serves me well.

Smiling: If eye contact means she’s interested, this means “you better come talk to me!”

She Approaches You: This goes without saying, although a lot of guys are so oblivious, they even miss this. If a woman approaches you, even if it’s to ask the time, about the weather, for directions, or whatever, chances are she has some interest in talking to you.

Proximity: This one is subtle, but the more you work on your lifestyle, body language, and style, the more of these you will get. It’s when a woman places herself conspicuously near you when she doesn’t have to. For instance, let’s say you’re sitting on a bus and an attractive woman gets on. The entire bus is empty, yet she comes over and sits across from you. This could mean she wants you to talk to her. Some other examples are when a woman comes and stands near you in a store or shop looking at nothing in particular for a long amount of time.”

##### Conversation Signals

Excessive Smiling/Laughing: This is subjective and will require some judgment, but sometimes you will notice one girl smiling and laughing a lot more than others when you speak. Chances are she likes you.

Flipping or Playing with Her Hair: Classic signal of flirtation and often done unconsciously.

Eyes Dilate: Studies have shown our eyes dilate when we look at someone we’re attracted to. Hard to notice, especially in some nighttime scenario. But this gives her eyes a much bigger and wider look than normal, what you may call “big doe eyes.”

Standing Closer to You Than Normal: self-explanatory. Pay attention to where she positions herself while talking to you. If it’s slightly within your bubble of personal space that probably indicates she’s interested in getting physical with you.

Excessive Eye Contact: Same as excessive smiling. If she’s locked onto your gaze during a conversation, that means she’s very interested in what you have to say. Most people break eye contact very often, especially with people they just met. If she doesn’t, that means she’s interested in you.

Prioritizes You: Another very subjective one. This can be very subtle. But it’s when her actions subtly show you that she prioritizes you over interacting with others. The classic example here is if you meet a girl at a bar and her friends come over and try to talk to her and she ignores her friends. Most women, if they don’t like you, will drop you like a hot potato when their friends come around. But if she ignores her friends or stays with you, that’s a clear indication that she likes you.

##### Escalation Signals

Isolates Herself with You: Oftentimes the most overt advances a woman will make won’t be in actually making a move (that’s your job), but they’ll actively work to put you in the easiest situation possible. Let’s say I’ve been hanging out with a woman at a small party for most of the night and she suddenly she says, “let’s take a walk around the block, it’s noisy in here,” she’s purposely isolating herself with me as much as possible. This typically means she wants to be kissed.

Ditches Her Friends For You: Goes along with the above; it takes a lot for a woman to leave her friends behind for a guy, especially one she’s only known for a few hours or one night. If she does this, take it as a bright green light.

Touches You: If she starts putting her hands on your arms or legs or is demonstrating (or reciprocating) any of the touching I described in the previous section, this is a clear signal: she is sexually interested in you and wants to be kissed.

##### When To Go For the Kiss

When it comes to kissing a woman, there’s an old adage amongst dating coaches: if you think you can kiss her, you probably could have ten minutes ago. We men are horrible at gauging a woman’s sexual desire and when she’s ready to move things forward.

So, in general, it’s safe to assume that anytime you think you could kiss her, you probably already could have. Too many guys get hung up looking for “sign” after “sign” when women have been giving them signals all night. Think of it this way: it’s much better to try and kiss her and get rejected than to go the whole night without making a move and never knowing what would have been.

So the rule of thumb is, when in doubt, go for it.

If you go in for the kiss and she turns her head or doesn’t reciprocate, pull back and ask her how she’s feeling, if she likes you or if you’re moving too fast. Listen to her response, often women will want to kiss you but there’s something that’s worrying them or upsetting them or making them self-conscious. The best way to deal with this is through vulnerability and simply asking her to be honest with whatever the issue is.

There are some women who don’t kiss in public places. They feel like it’s in bad taste and poor form. No matter how much they like you, they won’t do it.

The same goes if she’s in front of a bunch of people she knows. If she’s standing right next to four of her co-workers, she’s probably not going to feel comfortable making out with you. Try moving her somewhere more private.
Some notes on kissing well:

* Don’t slobber all over her face.
* Don’t jam your tongue down her throat. Heavy tongue has its place, but it’s usually in the bedroom when you guys are naked.  
* Don’t peck her like she’s your grandmother.   
* Don’t shove your face into hers or apply too much pressure. Kisses are sensual. Imagine you’re massaging her lips with yours.  

A lot of kissing revolves around how you use your hands as well. Your hands should be roaming her body gently, caressing her back, gently holding her neck, pulling her hips into yours. One of my favorite things to do while making out with a girl is to grab her belt loops on her pants and pull her hips into mine.

Don’t get ahead of yourself when you’re kissing. Too many men start making out with a woman and then immediately go into “OK, LET’S FUCK” mode where they practically start molesting her wherever they are and devouring her face.

Cool it. Kissing is simply the gateway to greater and deeper intimacy. Enjoy it, play with it, relax into it.

##### Moving Forward and Consent

So you’ve kissed her. Now what?

Assuming you’re in a discrete place, you’ve both gotten to know each other, and you’re both “fuck yes” about going further, then it’s time to escalate things towards sex.

Usually, the place to touch a woman that indicates you’re ready for sex and that isn’t acceptable unless she is as well are her breasts. If your hands find your way to them and she’s into it, then this is usually an indication that things are going to go further.

But believe it or not, women don’t just want to drop their pants and screw right there on the spot. Whereas men are like a microwave that you just press a button and the food is ready to go, women are like an oven. They need to be warmed up, pre-heated even. Remember, female arousal is primarily psychological. Therefore, there needs to be a sense of build-up to sex. You don’t just go from kissing to screwing (some women do, but typically not). Usually, you need to build up from light touching, to kissing, to kissing plus roaming hands, to some clothes off and more touching, and so on.

Women will often object at this point and say they just want to mess around and not have sex itself. The correct answer to any objection is always, “That’s fine. We’ll do whatever you’re comfortable doing.” The point is to have an enjoyable experience, not to get more notches on your bedpost.

Yes, women often say, “We’re not going to have sex tonight,” and then go ahead and have sex. And that’s fine too. Just accept that these things are often fluid and both you and her can opt in or opt out at any time without shame or judgment.

A quick note about rape because unfortunately I have to put something in here: remember, our general guideline here is that we continue until a woman makes us stop. This means she physically stops you — i.e., moves your hands off of her, moves away from you, puts her clothes back on, etc. — or clearly and verbally says, “STOP!” or “NO!”

If she’s incapacitated to the point (drunk, drugs, etc.) where she probably couldn’t opt out or make a clear decision, then you should stop. End of story.

Physicality is something you have to practice and become comfortable at. Every man develops his own style and personality to how he likes to touch, where he likes to touch, how he likes to move things forward. And as you develop your own style of physicality, you will begin to get a sense for when women are comfortable with what. The important thing is to see sex as not something you are earning or taking from a woman, but rather something you two are participating in together. It’s a team effort. Because, believe it or not, women want sex too. They want wild, passionate, crazy sex, just like you do.

##### Sex

No, seriously. Once you’ve got some clothes off and you’re both on a bed, a couch, the bathroom floor — or wherever you plan on doing the dirty — you’ve now entered the realm of foreplay. Sadly, men overlook foreplay because we’re just too damn excited about getting our dicks wet. The more foreplay there is, the hotter your woman’s going to be, the better sex she’s going to have, which means the better sex you’ll have (this is a team sport, remember?)

A good place to start is by sucking and massaging her bare breasts. Some girls who like it rougher like it when you gently bite on their nipples, but be careful, not every girl is into that.

From there, you should at least finger her or rub her clitoris. Feel how wet she is. If she’s wet, then slowly keep moving things forward. If she’s dry then slow down and take your time. She needs more time to get warmed up.

If you enjoy giving girls oral sex, this is an excellent time to do that as well. If you give good oral sex, most girls won’t be able to resist the urge to have sex then and there (some will even grab you and make you do it).

The most important thing to keep in mind about foreplay is the concept of teasing or expectation. As you do the things talked about above, don’t just rush into them and devour her. That can be cool sometimes, but in general, you want to take things slow, create a drawn-out and sensual is the concept of teasing or expectation. As you do the things talked about above, don’t just rush into them and devour her. That can be cool sometimes, but in general, you want to take things slow, create a drawn-out and sensual experience. Girls love to be teased. For instance, instead of just shoving your finger inside her and going at it, trying lightly touching her pussy with your fingertips for a few seconds. She’ll go crazy and want you inside her more than ever.

Instead of just giving her oral sex, start off slow by kissing the inside of her thighs, inching closer and closer. Create expectation. Make her yearn for whatever you’re about to do to her. Stuff like this drives girls crazy and makes them incredibly horny. If you do this well and repeatedly, you’ll often get girls pushing you down and forcing you to have sex. The expectation is too much. They have to have it. Right then and there.

When it comes to sex, more important than any physical technique — some cool angle or position or whatever — is being dominant. Sexual gratification for women is far more psychological than it is physical, whereas for men it’s mostly physical. A large component of this psychological satisfaction comes from being dominated and surrendering control. Women like to feel like you have the power and the control in the bedroom. They want you to be assertive and strong with what you want. So how do you become dominant in bed?”

1. Be loud. Make noise. Grunt. Breathe hard. Women love this because it makes them feel like they can be loud. And when they’re loud they get off easier and more often.  
2. Talk dirty. Tell her how sexy she is. Tell her what you’re going to do to her before you do it. Call her a dirty girl and a horny slut. This may be outside of your comfort zone, but realize that in the bedroom the rules change and logic goes out the window.  
3. Get physical. Spank her. Pull her hair. Hold her down with one hand. When you change positions, literally pick her up and move her yourself.  
4. Don’t ever ask, “Is this OK? Do you want to do X?” Just do it and stop later if she doesn’t like it and apologize. Nothing turns a girl off faster than a guy who defers to her too much while having sex. Take control. Do what turns you on and that will then turn her on.

The most important habit to develop, by far, is to talk and be expressive in the bedroom. There has to be an open forum of communication when you sleep with a woman, especially the first few times you’re together. Sex is always somewhat awkward the first time you’re with a new person. Everybody engages in different practices, habits and prefers different things. It takes a while to learn each other’s tendencies and adapt to one another’s likes and dislikes.
