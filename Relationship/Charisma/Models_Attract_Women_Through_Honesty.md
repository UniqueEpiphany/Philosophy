# Introduction : Movemet

Until you learn to trust your own actions and learn to pursue women with your own unique style and personality, you have learned absolutely nothing.

And I’ll give you a free preview: it has little to nothing to do with what you’re saying. It has everything to do with body, expression, emotion, and movement.

Emerson once wrote, “What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.” Seduction is the interplay of emotions. Your movement, or lack of movement, reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side effect. Sex is the side effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.

# Chapter 1  Non-Neediness

__A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The less needy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average. The needier he is, the less attractive he will be to women on average.__

Neediness is when a man places a higher priority on others’ perceptions of him than his perception of himself. A needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by impressing and winning approval from others. Non-neediness is when a man places a higher priority on his own perception of himself than the perceptions of others. A non-needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by embodying his own values and desires.

Neediness, therefore, infiltrates all behaviors because it is what inspires and instigates all behaviors. A lack of neediness also infiltrates all behaviors for the same reason. Because it underlies all of your actions and words, to be non-needy is to be more attractive, in every way. It defines and resonates in everything you say and do, the way you stand, the way you smile, the jokes you tell, the people you associate with, the car you drive, the wine you drink, the jacket you wear.

When people say vague things like, “I like the way he carries himself,” or “you just need to believe in yourself,” or, “he just has ‘it’, whatever ‘it’ is,” they are referring to a man’s lack of neediness. It exudes from him in everything he does. __Paradoxically, a man’s lack of need for attention and admiration is itself a magnet for attention and admiration. A man’s comfort and acceptance of the possibility that some people will not like him makes people like him even more. A man’s respect for differing opinions makes those around him want to agree with him more.__

A needy man is constantly investing in the perceptions others have in him. He is being extra nice and “friendly when he doesn’t want to be because he believes he must do this to be liked and loved. He is buying a fancy watch and season tickets to the local sports team so that he will be admired and loved. He is coming up with fake compliments or pretending to be a bad ass because he thinks it will get him attention and love.

A non-needy man may still do these behaviors — he may still buy the season tickets or make the jokes. But his intentions are different. Whereas a needy man says and does these things for approval, the non-needy man does them simply for the pleasure of doing. The needy man tries to control what others think and feel more than what he thinks and feels himself. The non-needy man is more concerned with controlling his own thoughts and feelings rather than the thoughts and feelings of others. A needy man will be more invested in the woman he is with than in himself – he will be more concerned about her opinion, about him, about the weather, about everything other than what he actually thinks and feels. A non-needy man will be more invested in himself than the woman he’s with.

By investment, I mean the degree to which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you.

That may sound cold, un-PC, and yes, it made me squirm a little bit when I first realized it. But it’s true.
Think about it, for the majority of human history, men had few material possessions by which women would judge their status. Back in the caveman days, there were no outdoor pools and tax returns. They didn’t have brand name sandals and expensive haircuts. At most, one man had a little bit more meat to share than the next guy.

Therefore, for the majority of human history, women watched men’s behavior. Ask yourself what kind of behavior would indicate to a woman that a “man is high status and fit to raise her children? These are the men who would be sexually selected over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

Would it be a man who defers to all of the other men around him, who begs the women to be with him, who can’t stand up for himself and whose emotions are dictated by those around him? Or would it be the man who controls his own destiny, is unfazed by the threats others may pose to him and who shrugs it off if he pursues a woman and she has no interest in him?
The second man indicates a man of status. If you’re at the top of the food chain, you have no reason to be inhibited or to defer to others (unless you want to). If you’re at the bottom of the food chain, your entire life will revolve around deferring to others.

The high-status man displays non-neediness. The low-status man displays neediness.

Neediness is not consciously calculated by women or people in general. I guarantee you will not see women walking around with neediness scorecards.

Neediness is a feeling. It’s intuited by women. It’s instinctual. It’s the gag reflex she has when a guy calls her twelve too many times. It’s the distaste she has when he seems to laugh a little too hard at her jokes. It’s the annoyance she has when he seems to make every decision for her rather than letting her fend for herself.

Women unconsciously detect neediness by sensing the intentions behind a man’s behavior and words. It’s why women can often become turned off at the most innocuous moment or by the most unimportant statement. Consciously, the action or statement may seem harmless, but unconsciously, it conveyed everything they need to know about your status and that is this: you base your actions on a constant need for approval.

As you are probably aware, women can be needy as well. And although neediness is a turn-off for most men, it’s not the complete deal breaker that it is for women.

To most women, a man with no neediness is like a woman with perfect tits and a gorgeously sculpted ass. To a woman, a man with a lot of neediness is like having the worst breath and missing teeth.

It’s important to note that non-neediness doesn’t mean you should only care about yourself. This is narcissism, and although it might get you laid, it is not attractive and will result in dysfunctional relationships.

When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her, you should be invested in her. That’s the whole fun of it! That’s the reason we have relationships in the first place, to be touched and moved by others. The important point here is how we prioritize other people’s perceptions versus our own. Which is more important? Hers or yours?

Highly needy men will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with highly needy women. The highly needy man is constantly working to earn a woman’s approval, and a highly needy woman is constantly in need of a man’s approval. So the two conspire together, usually with one creating drama/emotional meltdowns and the other one endlessly fixing it. This relationship is toxic and can harm each person’s self-worth.

Narcissistic men, or men who only care about themselves, will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with narcissistic and shallow women. Both the narcissistic man and woman will view each other merely as ornaments to adorn their self-absorbed lives. These relationships also are toxic. And these relationships also often end poorly.

Now all this stuff sounds nice. But let’s put this into concrete, real-world terms. Here are a couple examples.

### The Seduction Process

Biologically, women have a lot more to lose than men when it comes to sex. As a result, they’ve had incentives to (usually) be pickier in choosing their sexual partners. Men, on the other hand, have historically had fewer repercussions for promiscuity and, from a biological point of view, even gain some advantages by being promiscuous.

Whether it’s biological or cultural or some mixture of both, the fact is that female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets. Women have evolved a sexuality that is more psychological than physical, and that psychological need is rooted in the need for security and connection.

This is why status is based on behavior and not simply assets. A man who is rich in assets has greater potential to make a woman feel secure and comfortable, but if his behavior implies that he won’t, then she won’t be attracted to him. A physically fit man will imply greater fitness for her children, but again, if his behavior implies he will be incapable or incompetent in raising them, then she will not be attracted to him.

Because men value sex more than women at the beginning of a relationship, and sexual opportunities are scarcer for men than women, women tend to be less invested and more confident early in on the interaction. When a man approaches her and induces her to become as invested in him as he is in her, this is the process of seduction. Sex occurs as a natural side effect of this process.

__“Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in her.”__

There are two ways for seduction to happen: 1) a man creates the perception that he is far less invested in her than he actually is (neediness disguised as non-neediness), and 2) a man actually is less invested in her (genuine non-neediness).
The first method (a man giving false impressions) occurs through what I call “performance.” The vast majority of the dating advice out there for men (and women) is performance-based advice — say this, act like this, don’t call her back right away, pretend you don’t like her, make these jokes, etc.

The second method (a man demonstrating less investment) is a passive process that he does within himself and that permeates every aspect of his behavior over the long-term. There’s nothing to learn or memorize. There is nothing to practice or study. It only requires one to move his yardstick for success from external goals (more dates, more sex) to internal goals (better relationships, more emo“tional fulfillment, overall happiness). This book will lay out how this internal process occurs and how to achieve it in yourself.

Performance-based dating advice technically “works.” It’s just not fulfilling. You’re not actually solving the problem (your neediness); you're just covering it up. A man who becomes successful through a series of performance-based behaviors may have sex, but he is setting himself up for terrible and unfulfilling relationships with other needy women.”

Learning techniques and pick up lines without doing genuine, identity-level work in order to permanently decrease your neediness ends up only being a band-aid solution. It provides a short, temporary relief from an otherwise permanent problem. It causes more stress. And it ultimately makes us feel worse about ourselves.

Overcoming neediness is not about learning what to say or new things to do. Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect. It's as simple as just changing your mind about women.

Take a moment to consider: 

* That before meeting a woman, instead of worrying whether or not she will like you, you could wonder if you will like her.  
* That instead of feeling the need to impress her, you could wonder if she impresses you.  
* That instead of sitting there silently wondering what to say next to make her like you, you could sit there silently wondering what she will say to make you like her.  
*That instead of waiting around for her to call, you could find something else to do while she waits for your call.  
*That instead of worrying if you’re tall enough or good-looking enough or skinny enough, you could decide whether they’re too superficial to recognize your great qualities.  
* That instead of trying to come up with the perfect date, you could decide that a woman who really likes you for you doesn’t need a perfect date.   
* That instead of looking for a conversation she’ll enjoy, you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest.   
* That instead of looking for her approval, you could decide whether or not to give yours.  
* That instead of getting upset about why she doesn’t want to be with you, you could decide that it means you probably wouldn’t want to be with her.  
* This may all sound a bit selfish. But, in fact, it’s called having strong boundaries and high self-esteem. It’s called being non-needy and an attractive man. 
* Only making time for people who make time for you. Only being interested in dating people who are interested in dating you. Worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy. Looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs. Changing yourself to become who you want to be, not what you think women want you to be.

Because, ironically, that is what women want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be.  

Women are attracted to a man they can respect, to a man they can trust. If you’re constantly looking for approval for what to say and how to feel, how could anyone respect or trust you?  

You are what attracts (or repels) others — not the words, not the strategies. If you aren’t happy with the results you get, then it’s time to improve you.

I don’t care how hot she is. Is she good enough for you? Does she have integrity? Standards? Is she smart, personable, caring? Are you ready to leave on a dime if she offends you or breaks your trust?

If not, that’s probably why you’re not with her in first place.

The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Work on yourself. Conquer your anxieties. 

Resolve your shame. Take care of yourself and those who are important to you.

Love yourself. Otherwise no, one else will.

### Narcissism and Overcompensation

When a man has spent his entire life needy and highly invested, doing the legitimate work to transform himself into a confident, attractive man is not easy.

To become non-needy, a man must develop self-respect, a healthy sense of boundaries, social competence, and healthy life habits. It’s often a painful long-term process that entails quite a bit of introspection, questioning, doubt, anger, frustration, lifestyle changes, and so on.

But there is a shortcut. And that shortcut is to objectify women, to treat them as objects or trophies to be accumulated or paraded around for others.

As I said earlier, some men try to fake non-neediness through performance. We’ve already seen how this ultimately fails in the long run.

But other men overcompensate. It’s so hard for them to let go of what others think of them and to stand up for themselves. So they go the complete opposite direction and decide to only care about themselves. They become narcissistic and self-serving, they view their relationships as vehicles to get specific benefits and are unconcerned with the needs of the person they’re with.

Needy men only know how to care about what others want, even if it harms themselves. Non-needy men look for that intersection where they can get both their own needs and their partner’s needs met. Narcissistic men overcompensate and decide to only pursue getting their own needs met.

Narcissistic men usually do this by conjuring up all sorts of false beliefs about the inferiority or difference of women — how women are incapable of rationality, how they’re “hypergamous,” how they manipulate men, how women are destined to be dominated and controlled.

It’s all bullshit, but these men use it as a justification for their overcompensation to put them at ease in their own self-absorption.

Men who go narcissistic act like they’re more important than anybody else. They are aggressive, insensitive, and demanding. They are self-serving and don’t handle rejection or loss well. Some of these men even end up becoming abusive.

But the narcissist’s façade is weak and transparent. The truth is that the man’s narcissism is wielded as a sort of shield to protect the sensitive neediness underneath. See, narcissistic men are still desperate for the approval of others. They’ve just taken a counterintuitive route to getting it: their own self-aggrandizement. Whereas a needy man will play at being meek and unimportant in order to get approval from others, the narcissist proclaims his own greatness to get approval from others.

When a woman becomes merely another conquest, a number, something to treat like a trophy or a toy, it can be extremely easy to assert yourself around them, to prioritize your own values and beliefs over theirs, to risk rejection around them, and to dominate any perspective they might have — all attractive confident traits, merely expressed in horrible ways.

Narcissism is also taught to men as a form of dating advice. Much of the dating advice out there advises men to be selfish, to be “alpha,” to be dominant and aggressive and to ignore women’s objections or rejections, to pursue what you want no matter what and take it through pure persistence and aggression. It will justify this advice with all sorts of explanations that women don’t actually know what they want, that they’re just “testing” you, that they actually want it but they can’t say it, and so on.

Narcissism is also often promoted to men by other men growing up, especially in highly “macho” cultures (Latin America, the Middle East, East Asian, etc.). Men are often raised by other narcissistic men who only found their way through relationships through self-aggrandizement and selfishness, and so they seek to pass these traits onto their sons.

Narcissism in a relationship is built on the idea of always being dominant or in control. It is a nebulous mixture of selfishness, assertiveness, and domination that is achieved not through investing more in oneself, but by minimizing the importance of others.

This strategy is ultimately self-sabotaging then. Narcissistic men see seduction and relationships as another competition to be dominated and won, not as a collaboration to be enjoyed. If the goal is to cultivate highly enriching relationships that add to one’s life, then minimizing the importance of those around you in order to attract them to you makes the resulting relationships unfulfilling and superficial.

Narcissistic men end up with narcissistic and/or highly needy women. Narcissistic women will use the narcissistic man to aggrandize themselves, to put themselves up and fulfill their own egotistical goals. Needy women will tolerate a narcissistic man’s poor treatment of them because the needy woman is constantly in search of a feeling of greatness herself.

And the sad thing is, it works — not on all women, not even on most women, but it will work on women who have no confidence, who expect to be treated like shit, and who treat men like shit in return. Women with any self-worth will pass up on a narcissistic man in a heartbeat. She sees right through his macho veneer. But low self-esteem women, particularly women with truckloads of emotional problems or a history of abuse, will gladly throw themselves onto the narcissistic man and bring him down with them.

So yeah, being narcissistic and overcompensating works. But it leads to unpleasant, shallow, and superficial interactions, constant headaches dealing with women who you don’t actually even really like and who probably don’t even actually like you, women regretting having sex with you, and emotionally unstable girls who bother you constantly. It’s like swimming in the shallow end of the pool — yeah, you’re swimming, but it’s not nearly as rewarding as the deep end, and there’s piss everywhere.

Narcissism comes in many varieties but usually boils down to this: focusing on your own wants and desires to the point of imposing them onto others. Exaggerate your dominance and boast of your strength. Accept no wrongdoing. Admit no faults. Blame others for your problems. Go out of your way to make others feel smaller so that you appear bigger.

The problem with narcissism is that it defines itself by getting what it wants from others. A man who is narcissistic only feels non-needy if he’s dominating somebody else and if someone else is giving him what he wants. And in that subtle way, he is therefore more invested in others than he is in himself. He is therefore still needy and unattractive.

To give an example, if a non-needy man meets a woman who rejects him or is not interested in him, he will assume that is was either an incompatibility or that it was just not the right situation. Either way, he will see it as the right thing to have happened. His life will go on.

But when a narcissistic man is rejected, he becomes angry and hurt. He blames the woman for not seeing his greatness. He calls her stupid or selfish or shallow because she’s not willing to give him what he – a random guy talking to her – wants.

It’s just another form of performance — he acts as if he’s in control, but his desperation to be in control is due to insecurity. A non-needy man doesn’t try to control what women feel about him. Rather he tries to control what he feels about certain women. He understands that the world isn’t about him and that all he can control is himself and his own actions. He’s not bothered when things don’t go his way or when people don’t recognize him as being amazing because he already feels amazing himself. He doesn’t need their approval and their disapproval doesn’t faze him from his mission.

Narcissistic men are often serial players, guys who obsessively seek out casual sex and not only regard the women they sleep with poorly, but treat them poorly as well.

I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It’s a reflection of your neediness. Non-needy people don’t date needy people and vice-versa. They can’t because there’s no attraction to begin with.

If all of the women you attract are needy and emotionally helpless, what does that say about you?

The key to non-neediness is to have both: respect for both oneself and for women.

__The only permanent way to attract and date more women and more attractive women is to become more attractive yourself. And the way a man becomes more attractive himself is by investing in himself, in becoming less needy.__

Permanent change to one’s investment and neediness in one’s relationships with women is hard and is a process that encompasses all facets of one’s life. But it’s a worthwhile journey. As a man, it may be the most worthwhile journey.

And the key to it is probably something you wouldn’t expect. In fact, it’s something that most men turn their nose up at when they hear it. The key is vulnerability.
