# Introduction : Movemet

Until you learn to trust your own actions and learn to pursue women with your own unique style and personality, you have learned absolutely nothing.

And I’ll give you a free preview: it has little to nothing to do with what you’re saying. It has everything to do with body, expression, emotion, and movement.

Emerson once wrote, “What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.” Seduction is the interplay of emotions. Your movement, or lack of movement, reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side effect. Sex is the side effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.

# Chapter 1  Non-Neediness

__A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The less needy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average. The needier he is, the less attractive he will be to women on average.__

Neediness is when a man places a higher priority on others’ perceptions of him than his perception of himself. A needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by impressing and winning approval from others. Non-neediness is when a man places a higher priority on his own perception of himself than the perceptions of others. A non-needy man’s actions and words will therefore be primarily motivated by embodying his own values and desires.

Neediness, therefore, infiltrates all behaviors because it is what inspires and instigates all behaviors. A lack of neediness also infiltrates all behaviors for the same reason. Because it underlies all of your actions and words, to be non-needy is to be more attractive, in every way. It defines and resonates in everything you say and do, the way you stand, the way you smile, the jokes you tell, the people you associate with, the car you drive, the wine you drink, the jacket you wear.

When people say vague things like, “I like the way he carries himself,” or “you just need to believe in yourself,” or, “he just has ‘it’, whatever ‘it’ is,” they are referring to a man’s lack of neediness. It exudes from him in everything he does. __Paradoxically, a man’s lack of need for attention and admiration is itself a magnet for attention and admiration. A man’s comfort and acceptance of the possibility that some people will not like him makes people like him even more. A man’s respect for differing opinions makes those around him want to agree with him more.__

A needy man is constantly investing in the perceptions others have in him. He is being extra nice and “friendly when he doesn’t want to be because he believes he must do this to be liked and loved. He is buying a fancy watch and season tickets to the local sports team so that he will be admired and loved. He is coming up with fake compliments or pretending to be a bad ass because he thinks it will get him attention and love.

A non-needy man may still do these behaviors — he may still buy the season tickets or make the jokes. But his intentions are different. Whereas a needy man says and does these things for approval, the non-needy man does them simply for the pleasure of doing. The needy man tries to control what others think and feel more than what he thinks and feels himself. The non-needy man is more concerned with controlling his own thoughts and feelings rather than the thoughts and feelings of others. A needy man will be more invested in the woman he is with than in himself – he will be more concerned about her opinion, about him, about the weather, about everything other than what he actually thinks and feels. A non-needy man will be more invested in himself than the woman he’s with.

By investment, I mean the degree to which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you.

That may sound cold, un-PC, and yes, it made me squirm a little bit when I first realized it. But it’s true.
Think about it, for the majority of human history, men had few material possessions by which women would judge their status. Back in the caveman days, there were no outdoor pools and tax returns. They didn’t have brand name sandals and expensive haircuts. At most, one man had a little bit more meat to share than the next guy.

Therefore, for the majority of human history, women watched men’s behavior. Ask yourself what kind of behavior would indicate to a woman that a “man is high status and fit to raise her children? These are the men who would be sexually selected over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

Would it be a man who defers to all of the other men around him, who begs the women to be with him, who can’t stand up for himself and whose emotions are dictated by those around him? Or would it be the man who controls his own destiny, is unfazed by the threats others may pose to him and who shrugs it off if he pursues a woman and she has no interest in him?
The second man indicates a man of status. If you’re at the top of the food chain, you have no reason to be inhibited or to defer to others (unless you want to). If you’re at the bottom of the food chain, your entire life will revolve around deferring to others.

The high-status man displays non-neediness. The low-status man displays neediness.

Neediness is not consciously calculated by women or people in general. I guarantee you will not see women walking around with neediness scorecards.

Neediness is a feeling. It’s intuited by women. It’s instinctual. It’s the gag reflex she has when a guy calls her twelve too many times. It’s the distaste she has when he seems to laugh a little too hard at her jokes. It’s the annoyance she has when he seems to make every decision for her rather than letting her fend for herself.

Women unconsciously detect neediness by sensing the intentions behind a man’s behavior and words. It’s why women can often become turned off at the most innocuous moment or by the most unimportant statement. Consciously, the action or statement may seem harmless, but unconsciously, it conveyed everything they need to know about your status and that is this: you base your actions on a constant need for approval.

As you are probably aware, women can be needy as well. And although neediness is a turn-off for most men, it’s not the complete deal breaker that it is for women.

To most women, a man with no neediness is like a woman with perfect tits and a gorgeously sculpted ass. To a woman, a man with a lot of neediness is like having the worst breath and missing teeth.

It’s important to note that non-neediness doesn’t mean you should only care about yourself. This is narcissism, and although it might get you laid, it is not attractive and will result in dysfunctional relationships.

When you are attracted to a woman, you should be affected by her, you should be invested in her. That’s the whole fun of it! That’s the reason we have relationships in the first place, to be touched and moved by others. The important point here is how we prioritize other people’s perceptions versus our own. Which is more important? Hers or yours?

Highly needy men will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with highly needy women. The highly needy man is constantly working to earn a woman’s approval, and a highly needy woman is constantly in need of a man’s approval. So the two conspire together, usually with one creating drama/emotional meltdowns and the other one endlessly fixing it. This relationship is toxic and can harm each person’s self-worth.

Narcissistic men, or men who only care about themselves, will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with narcissistic and shallow women. Both the narcissistic man and woman will view each other merely as ornaments to adorn their self-absorbed lives. These relationships also are toxic. And these relationships also often end poorly.

Now all this stuff sounds nice. But let’s put this into concrete, real-world terms. Here are a couple examples.

### The Seduction Process

Biologically, women have a lot more to lose than men when it comes to sex. As a result, they’ve had incentives to (usually) be pickier in choosing their sexual partners. Men, on the other hand, have historically had fewer repercussions for promiscuity and, from a biological point of view, even gain some advantages by being promiscuous.

Whether it’s biological or cultural or some mixture of both, the fact is that female sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a man she meets. Women have evolved a sexuality that is more psychological than physical, and that psychological need is rooted in the need for security and connection.

This is why status is based on behavior and not simply assets. A man who is rich in assets has greater potential to make a woman feel secure and comfortable, but if his behavior implies that he won’t, then she won’t be attracted to him. A physically fit man will imply greater fitness for her children, but again, if his behavior implies he will be incapable or incompetent in raising them, then she will not be attracted to him.

Because men value sex more than women at the beginning of a relationship, and sexual opportunities are scarcer for men than women, women tend to be less invested and more confident early in on the interaction. When a man approaches her and induces her to become as invested in him as he is in her, this is the process of seduction. Sex occurs as a natural side effect of this process.

__“Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in her.”__

There are two ways for seduction to happen: 1) a man creates the perception that he is far less invested in her than he actually is (neediness disguised as non-neediness), and 2) a man actually is less invested in her (genuine non-neediness).
The first method (a man giving false impressions) occurs through what I call “performance.” The vast majority of the dating advice out there for men (and women) is performance-based advice — say this, act like this, don’t call her back right away, pretend you don’t like her, make these jokes, etc.

The second method (a man demonstrating less investment) is a passive process that he does within himself and that permeates every aspect of his behavior over the long-term. There’s nothing to learn or memorize. There is nothing to practice or study. It only requires one to move his yardstick for success from external goals (more dates, more sex) to internal goals (better relationships, more emo“tional fulfillment, overall happiness). This book will lay out how this internal process occurs and how to achieve it in yourself.

Performance-based dating advice technically “works.” It’s just not fulfilling. You’re not actually solving the problem (your neediness); you're just covering it up. A man who becomes successful through a series of performance-based behaviors may have sex, but he is setting himself up for terrible and unfulfilling relationships with other needy women.”

Learning techniques and pick up lines without doing genuine, identity-level work in order to permanently decrease your neediness ends up only being a band-aid solution. It provides a short, temporary relief from an otherwise permanent problem. It causes more stress. And it ultimately makes us feel worse about ourselves.

Overcoming neediness is not about learning what to say or new things to do. Overcoming your neediness comes through a change in your mindset, your self-perception, and your self-respect. It's as simple as just changing your mind about women.

Take a moment to consider: 

* That before meeting a woman, instead of worrying whether or not she will like you, you could wonder if you will like her.  
* That instead of feeling the need to impress her, you could wonder if she impresses you.  
* That instead of sitting there silently wondering what to say next to make her like you, you could sit there silently wondering what she will say to make you like her.  
*That instead of waiting around for her to call, you could find something else to do while she waits for your call.  
*That instead of worrying if you’re tall enough or good-looking enough or skinny enough, you could decide whether they’re too superficial to recognize your great qualities.  
* That instead of trying to come up with the perfect date, you could decide that a woman who really likes you for you doesn’t need a perfect date.   
* That instead of looking for a conversation she’ll enjoy, you could talk about something you enjoy and see if she takes interest.   
* That instead of looking for her approval, you could decide whether or not to give yours.  
* That instead of getting upset about why she doesn’t want to be with you, you could decide that it means you probably wouldn’t want to be with her.  
* This may all sound a bit selfish. But, in fact, it’s called having strong boundaries and high self-esteem. It’s called being non-needy and an attractive man. 
* Only making time for people who make time for you. Only being interested in dating people who are interested in dating you. Worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy. Looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs. Changing yourself to become who you want to be, not what you think women want you to be.

Because, ironically, that is what women want you to be: a man who wants to be who he wants to be.  

Women are attracted to a man they can respect, to a man they can trust. If you’re constantly looking for approval for what to say and how to feel, how could anyone respect or trust you?  

You are what attracts (or repels) others — not the words, not the strategies. If you aren’t happy with the results you get, then it’s time to improve you.

I don’t care how hot she is. Is she good enough for you? Does she have integrity? Standards? Is she smart, personable, caring? Are you ready to leave on a dime if she offends you or breaks your trust?

If not, that’s probably why you’re not with her in first place.

The only real dating advice is self-improvement. Work on yourself. Conquer your anxieties. 

Resolve your shame. Take care of yourself and those who are important to you.

Love yourself. Otherwise no, one else will.

### Narcissism and Overcompensation

When a man has spent his entire life needy and highly invested, doing the legitimate work to transform himself into a confident, attractive man is not easy.

To become non-needy, a man must develop self-respect, a healthy sense of boundaries, social competence, and healthy life habits. It’s often a painful long-term process that entails quite a bit of introspection, questioning, doubt, anger, frustration, lifestyle changes, and so on.

But there is a shortcut. And that shortcut is to objectify women, to treat them as objects or trophies to be accumulated or paraded around for others.

As I said earlier, some men try to fake non-neediness through performance. We’ve already seen how this ultimately fails in the long run.

But other men overcompensate. It’s so hard for them to let go of what others think of them and to stand up for themselves. So they go the complete opposite direction and decide to only care about themselves. They become narcissistic and self-serving, they view their relationships as vehicles to get specific benefits and are unconcerned with the needs of the person they’re with.

Needy men only know how to care about what others want, even if it harms themselves. Non-needy men look for that intersection where they can get both their own needs and their partner’s needs met. Narcissistic men overcompensate and decide to only pursue getting their own needs met.

Narcissistic men usually do this by conjuring up all sorts of false beliefs about the inferiority or difference of women — how women are incapable of rationality, how they’re “hypergamous,” how they manipulate men, how women are destined to be dominated and controlled.

It’s all bullshit, but these men use it as a justification for their overcompensation to put them at ease in their own self-absorption.

Men who go narcissistic act like they’re more important than anybody else. They are aggressive, insensitive, and demanding. They are self-serving and don’t handle rejection or loss well. Some of these men even end up becoming abusive.

But the narcissist’s façade is weak and transparent. The truth is that the man’s narcissism is wielded as a sort of shield to protect the sensitive neediness underneath. See, narcissistic men are still desperate for the approval of others. They’ve just taken a counterintuitive route to getting it: their own self-aggrandizement. Whereas a needy man will play at being meek and unimportant in order to get approval from others, the narcissist proclaims his own greatness to get approval from others.

When a woman becomes merely another conquest, a number, something to treat like a trophy or a toy, it can be extremely easy to assert yourself around them, to prioritize your own values and beliefs over theirs, to risk rejection around them, and to dominate any perspective they might have — all attractive confident traits, merely expressed in horrible ways.

Narcissism is also taught to men as a form of dating advice. Much of the dating advice out there advises men to be selfish, to be “alpha,” to be dominant and aggressive and to ignore women’s objections or rejections, to pursue what you want no matter what and take it through pure persistence and aggression. It will justify this advice with all sorts of explanations that women don’t actually know what they want, that they’re just “testing” you, that they actually want it but they can’t say it, and so on.

Narcissism is also often promoted to men by other men growing up, especially in highly “macho” cultures (Latin America, the Middle East, East Asian, etc.). Men are often raised by other narcissistic men who only found their way through relationships through self-aggrandizement and selfishness, and so they seek to pass these traits onto their sons.

Narcissism in a relationship is built on the idea of always being dominant or in control. It is a nebulous mixture of selfishness, assertiveness, and domination that is achieved not through investing more in oneself, but by minimizing the importance of others.

This strategy is ultimately self-sabotaging then. Narcissistic men see seduction and relationships as another competition to be dominated and won, not as a collaboration to be enjoyed. If the goal is to cultivate highly enriching relationships that add to one’s life, then minimizing the importance of those around you in order to attract them to you makes the resulting relationships unfulfilling and superficial.

Narcissistic men end up with narcissistic and/or highly needy women. Narcissistic women will use the narcissistic man to aggrandize themselves, to put themselves up and fulfill their own egotistical goals. Needy women will tolerate a narcissistic man’s poor treatment of them because the needy woman is constantly in search of a feeling of greatness herself.

And the sad thing is, it works — not on all women, not even on most women, but it will work on women who have no confidence, who expect to be treated like shit, and who treat men like shit in return. Women with any self-worth will pass up on a narcissistic man in a heartbeat. She sees right through his macho veneer. But low self-esteem women, particularly women with truckloads of emotional problems or a history of abuse, will gladly throw themselves onto the narcissistic man and bring him down with them.

So yeah, being narcissistic and overcompensating works. But it leads to unpleasant, shallow, and superficial interactions, constant headaches dealing with women who you don’t actually even really like and who probably don’t even actually like you, women regretting having sex with you, and emotionally unstable girls who bother you constantly. It’s like swimming in the shallow end of the pool — yeah, you’re swimming, but it’s not nearly as rewarding as the deep end, and there’s piss everywhere.

Narcissism comes in many varieties but usually boils down to this: focusing on your own wants and desires to the point of imposing them onto others. Exaggerate your dominance and boast of your strength. Accept no wrongdoing. Admit no faults. Blame others for your problems. Go out of your way to make others feel smaller so that you appear bigger.

The problem with narcissism is that it defines itself by getting what it wants from others. A man who is narcissistic only feels non-needy if he’s dominating somebody else and if someone else is giving him what he wants. And in that subtle way, he is therefore more invested in others than he is in himself. He is therefore still needy and unattractive.

To give an example, if a non-needy man meets a woman who rejects him or is not interested in him, he will assume that is was either an incompatibility or that it was just not the right situation. Either way, he will see it as the right thing to have happened. His life will go on.

But when a narcissistic man is rejected, he becomes angry and hurt. He blames the woman for not seeing his greatness. He calls her stupid or selfish or shallow because she’s not willing to give him what he – a random guy talking to her – wants.

It’s just another form of performance — he acts as if he’s in control, but his desperation to be in control is due to insecurity. A non-needy man doesn’t try to control what women feel about him. Rather he tries to control what he feels about certain women. He understands that the world isn’t about him and that all he can control is himself and his own actions. He’s not bothered when things don’t go his way or when people don’t recognize him as being amazing because he already feels amazing himself. He doesn’t need their approval and their disapproval doesn’t faze him from his mission.

Narcissistic men are often serial players, guys who obsessively seek out casual sex and not only regard the women they sleep with poorly, but treat them poorly as well.

I always tell men, if every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that’s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It’s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It’s a reflection of your neediness. Non-needy people don’t date needy people and vice-versa. They can’t because there’s no attraction to begin with.

If all of the women you attract are needy and emotionally helpless, what does that say about you?

The key to non-neediness is to have both: respect for both oneself and for women.

__The only permanent way to attract and date more women and more attractive women is to become more attractive yourself. And the way a man becomes more attractive himself is by investing in himself, in becoming less needy.__

Permanent change to one’s investment and neediness in one’s relationships with women is hard and is a process that encompasses all facets of one’s life. But it’s a worthwhile journey. As a man, it may be the most worthwhile journey.

And the key to it is probably something you wouldn’t expect. In fact, it’s something that most men turn their nose up at when they hear it. The key is vulnerability.

## Chapter 2 Power in Vulnerability

When most men hear the word “vulnerability,” their immediate reaction is to associate it with weakness. In general, men are raised to withhold their emotions, to not show weakness, and to ignore any hint of introspection. On top of that, most of the popular dating advice out there encourages guys to be aloof, standoffish, judgmental, and at times, scathing towards women.

For instance, making yourself vulnerable doesn’t just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don’t know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. All of these things require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way. You’re making yourself vulnerable when you do them.

In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. It’s courageous, even. A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” He’s saying he is non-needy and high status.

Most people think of a man who’s vulnerable as a man who cowers in the corner and begs others to accept him or not hurt him. This is not vulnerability; this is surrender. It’s weakness.

Think of it this way, there are two men. One stands tall, looks straight ahead. Looks people in the eye when he speaks to them. Says what he thinks and is comfortable if some people disagree with him. When he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off and apologizes if necessary. When he sucks at something, he admits it. He’s unafraid to express his emotions, even if that means he gets rejected because of them sometimes. He has no problem moving on to people who don’t reject him, but instead like him for who he is.

The second man hunches over, his eyes dart around and he is unable to look someone in the eye without getting uncomfortable. He puts on a cool persona that is always aloof. He performs. He avoids saying things that may upset others, and sometimes even lies to avoid conflict. He’s always trying to impress people. When he makes a mistake, he tries to blame others or pretend like it didn’t happen. He hides his emotions and will smile and tell everyone he’s fine even when he’s not. He’s scared to death of rejection. And when he is rejected, it sends him reeling, angry, and desperate to find a way to win back the affection of the person who doesn’t like him.

Which one of these two men is more powerful? Which one is more vulnerable? Which one is more comfortable with himself? Which one do you think women would be more attracted to?

From an evolutionary perspective, vulnerability makes perfect sense as an indicator to women of male status and fitness. Let’s say there’s a tribe of 20 men, all hunter-gatherers, all men with more or less equal possessions (or lack thereof).

Some of the men in the tribe are constantly reactive to what the other men tell them. They don’t admit faults. They change their behavior and what they say to win the approval of the other men. When something doesn’t go their way, they look to blame someone else. What would this say about their status in their tribe? If they’re basing all of their behavior on the approval of the other men and are constantly covering up their weaknesses, it says that they’re low status, not trustworthy, unconfident, and probably not going to be a dependable father.

Now imagine other men in the same tribe who are unfazed by the neediness or temper tantrums of the other men around them. They focus purely on the task at hand and don’t change their behavior based on what others think of them. When challenged, they stand up for themselves, but when they’re wrong, they also admit their fault since they see no reason to hide their weakness. They have a sense of honor. They don’t react to any of the other men around them; rather, the other men react to them.

This behavior implies high status, a man who is dependable, comfortable in his strengths and weaknesses, a man who can be counted on and who is likely to rise through the ranks and provide for his offspring.

He’s likely to succeed and likely to be a dependable father. It’s likely that women have been naturally selected to choose high-status men based on their non-neediness first, and then their looks and accomplishments second, since looks and accomplishments tend to be reflections of non-needy behavior, not the other way around. This non-needy behavior indicates a man who is comfortable with vulnerability, who isn’t afraid to express who he is, warts and all, to the world. This plays out in multiple arenas — in the life decisions he makes, the extent of his courage and the way he communicates to others.

Chances are, if you’re reading this and are bad with women, then you’re bad with women because you don’t express your true feelings and intentions very well. Perhaps you’re afraid to introduce yourself to women you find attractive or to ask them out on a date. Perhaps you consistently fall into boring conversation topics because they’re “safe” and shallow and you don’t have to risk offending or inciting any one with them. Perhaps you don’t assert yourself and your desires enough. Perhaps you hide from your own sexuality and become scared or nervous when people expose theirs. Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint the people around you. Dressing extremely well makes you feel uncomfortable, smiling at strangers makes you feel creepy, and the idea of hitting on a woman openly scares you because of the possibility of rejection.

All of these are symptoms of a root problem: an inability to be vulnerable.

Many men, like you, and like me, were raised in such a way as to not express our emotions freely. For whatever reason — maybe our home situation, maybe childhood trauma, maybe our parents didn’t express their emotions either — we’ve grown up with deeply embedded habits designed to keep us stifled and bottled up. Don’t be controversial. Don’t be unique. Don’t do anything “crazy” or “stupid” or “selfish.”

Connecting with women in this way, by being vulnerable — as opposed to performance or narcissism — will result in some of the best interactions and relationships of your life. Vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person. As psychologist Robert Glover once said, “Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.

Show your rough edges. Stop trying to be perfect. Expose yourself and share yourself without inhibition. Take the rejections and lumps and move on because you’re a bigger and stronger man. And when you find a woman who loves who you are (and you will), revel in her affection.

But opening yourself up to vulnerability, training yourself to become comfortable with your emotions, with your faults, and with expressing yourself without inhibitions doesn’t happen overnight. This entire book can be viewed as a how-to guide for vulnerability. But it’s a process, and at times, a grueling one.

### The Pain Period

Maybe you’ve already been through this. Maybe you’ve already spent months or years avoiding taking action because you’re afraid of the consequences. Maybe you’ve put off that career change, that wardrobe upgrade, joining that dating site. Maybe you’ve missed opportunities with women who liked you because you were too afraid to make a move. Maybe you convinced yourself that you needed to “know how” first. Maybe you convinced yourself that you needed to see someone else do it first.
These are all forms of avoidance. And they all come from a deep-seated neediness, and that neediness can only be cured through making yourself more vulnerable. And at first, that vulnerability is going to hurt.

You can’t skip it. The only way out of it is through it.

We all have weaknesses, embarrassments, and vulnerabilities. A needy man is terrified to show them because he cares more about what others feel about him than what he feels about himself. A non-needy man is comfortable showing his flaws because he’s more comfortable with how he feels about himself than how others feel about him.

Sharing yourself openly with others forces that transition between the two: from needy and afraid of what others think, to non-needy and comfortable in how you feel about yourself. __The reason is because sharing these truths about yourself forces you to own them and accept them, and also demonstrates that feeling embarrassed or ashamed is just that, just another feeling, another part of your humanity, not the end of the world.__

The real question is, do you have to work through this emotional baggage and neediness with the women you’re dating? Not necessarily. You can work through them by sharing them with friends, family members, or a therapist. But there are some issues that can only be dealt with by women you’re seeing: particularly intimacy and sexual issues.

But slowly, you will chisel away at yourself. You’ll humble yourself, expose yourself, and then learn that it’s OK. It’s OK to be rejected. It’s OK to make mistakes. It’s OK to say something stupid. Don’t give up. Women will not dislike you for your rejections and mistakes or saying something stupid.

They’ll like you for your ability to be OK with being rejected, to make mistakes, and to say something stupid. The man who always has the perfect line to say to her is a man she will not trust because he shows no vulnerability and his words are inauthentic and, therefore, needy.

The man who has some good lines and some bad lines and is able to admit the latter and laugh at the former, this is a man she will trust and a man she will open herself up to, both emotionally and physically. Become comfortable with being imperfect. It’s your rough edges she’ll be attracted to.

__Ultimately, what women want — what we all really want — is a strong, independent, non-needy partner who fulfills us, who we can share ourselves with and receive them in return.__

Stop looking at communication as the surface information and instead, pay attention to the emotions and motivations behind everything that you do and say. That's where all of the meaning is.

I’ll say this again because this often gets lost: vulnerability is not a technique or tactic. It is a way of being. It’s not something you learn, it’s a mindset you practice.

Here’s a piece of advice: if you ever find yourself thinking, “That didn’t work,” or “This doesn’t work,” then you are performing and you are needy. Point blank. Period.

The whole idea of something “working” on women, is itself a form of neediness. Because a sexual connection is not something you achieve. It’s not a level in a video game that you beat. It’s not something you can strategize. It’s either there or it’s not.

When women emotionally connect with you and your desire for them, it’s not what you’re saying or the words you’re choosing, it’s the emotion behind those words. If the emotion behind your words is needy and self-serving, then she will become turned off no matter what you say, even if you’re telling her the most personal or heartfelt story. If the emotion behind your words is genuine and vulnerable, then it will turn her on, even if you’re talking about your grocery list or how you named your dog. Yes, you can fake this stuff in the short-term if you become a good actor. But obviously, don’t do that. We’re not in this for short-term fixes, remember?

So the catch is that your statements must be authentic. Your statements towards women must be unconditional, otherwise it’s not really being vulnerable. If you tell a woman that she’s beautiful only because you think it’ll give you a better chance of sleeping with her, then amazingly, she will not be very flattered. Try it. It’s true. Give women false compliments and see how they respond. They won’t respond very well.

But communicate with honest appreciation and you’ll be amazed how she lights up in front of you.

So the catch is that everything you say must be as authentic as possible. There’s no shortcut. There are no tricks. You say it because you mean it and mean it because you say it. The more nervous it makes you, the better, because it means you’re being authentic and making yourself vulnerable.

How attractive you are is based on your lack of neediness. Your non-neediness is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others.

## Chapter 3 “The Gift of Truth”

But what I learned is that regardless of what you say to a woman, the intention and implications of why you are saying it are far more powerful than the words themselves.

You can say the lamest and grossest (or funniest, depending on your perspective) thing to women, and if the sub-communication is, “I really don’t care if you laugh or run away horrified, but here’s who I am, take it or leave it,” this sub-communicates a rock-bottom level of investment and an incredibly high level of vulnerability.

Most men can relate to the idea of trying to “pick up” a woman without looking like they’re trying. Or trying to be cool without looking like they’re trying to be cool. Entire books and schools of dating advice have been built on this idea — pursuing a woman without actually letting her know that you’re interested in her.

Just typing that paragraph feels exhausting. Talk about a lot of work for nothing.

Like I described before, this performance-based stuff works sometimes, but it’s a short-term solution that requires a lot of time and effort. In my opinion, it’s a terrible investment of time and effort. You may as well invest that time and effort in yourself and let your identity and honesty do all of the attracting for you.

After all, why learn how to fake being cool, when you can just learn to become cool yourself?

On top of that, walking the tightrope of pursuing her without looking like you’re pursuing her requires a lot of attention and effort. You can slip up easily. It’s very unforgiving and ultimately, not a very enjoyable process. Besides, all of the attention and effort on “gaming” women this way ironically encourages you to be even more highly-invested and needy, therefore decreasing her likely attraction for you.

Men avoid demonstrating an honest interest in a woman because they believe it will signify that they are too invested in her — i.e., it will show that they are needy. They think that when you say, “You’re cute and I wanted to meet you,” that translates roughly to, “Hi, I’m such a desperate loser that I’m just going to throw all of my desires out there right now and beg you to accept them.”

But remember, it’s not the actual behaviors or words themselves, it’s the intentions behind those words. There’s a world of sub-communication going on behind a man’s honest declaration of his interest. And it’s an attractive one.

Because when a man comes right out and says he’s interested in a woman, the sub-communication is actually, “I’m totally OK with the idea of you rejecting me, otherwise I would not be approaching you in this manner. Therefore, I'm comfortable with myself and my prospects.”

Think about it, if a guy wasn’t comfortable with the prospect of a woman rejecting him, he wouldn’t have been honest in the first place. In fact, he would have pretended that he wasn’t actually interested in her!

The fact that he honestly expressed to her his intentions, that he put his nuts on the chopping block and made himself vulnerable to her immediately, actually sub-communicates non-neediness and attractiveness in itself. And on top of that, it shows desire for her, which is going to trigger her arousal.

Remember: what you actually say doesn’t matter; why you say it matters.

Always. No exceptions. You can have the best line in the world, but if you’re saying it because you’re needy and desperate for validation and approval from women, then she is immediately going to sense it.

This is why using pick up lines is ultimately a futile process. I could sell you the best 100 things I’ve ever said to women, but I can’t ever sell you my intentions or my confidence in myself. You must develop those on your own. And once you do, the actual lines you say will be personal and congruent to you and nobody else.

### The Truth Is Always Shining Through

This is because the truth is always shining through. You can’t fake vulnerability and you can’t fake honesty. By their very definition, it’s impossible.

Men’s dating advice gives women very little credit when it comes to this. Women are generally quite intuitive to emotions, motivations, and social cues. We may think we’re clever when we come up with a cute line to approach a woman with, thinking that she has absolutely no idea that we’re secretly hitting on her. She does. They always do. And it’s not a big deal either.

And not only does she know we’re hitting on her, the fact that we seemed so concerned about getting rejected turns her off. The fact that we had to contrive lines and fake stories in order to start a conversation with her, whether consciously or not, signals to her that we are highly invested and not a truly attractive man.

You cannot fake non-neediness for more than a moment. The only women you will manage to fake are women who are drunk or who are extremely needy themselves. Truth.

Non-needy and truly high-quality women who are not invested in the attention they receive from men are not going to have much patience for your lines and games. They will either see through them and see you for who you really are — scared to expose your vulnerability — or they will simply assume you’re not worth investing in because you’d rather just talk about spells or games or whatever.

Vulnerability requires honesty, and honesty only works if it’s given unconditionally, with no strings attached. That means everything you say and do must be done without any ulterior motive. You are simply expressing your thoughts and feelings as they come to you, without inhibition, without shame.

The truth is always shining through. Even if you lie about yourself or act a certain way, this is actually saying much more about you and your character than the content of your statements. Even if you are exaggerating or putting on a bit of an act to impress a person, your intentions will always shine through, eventually, and they will say more about you than any word ever could.

If you pretend you don’t like a woman, ignore her, act like what she says is stupid or uninteresting, when in fact you do like her, and you are interested in what she says, subtle cues in your behavior and body language will slowly but surely tip you off. The armor will crack. It may be laughing too much at your own joke. Or tilting your head away at an awkward moment. Or making an awkward comment to her friend that feels forced. But people’s bullshit detectors will eventually go off, and you’ll be exposed for not presenting an honest expression of yourself.

But what about men who gush about how beautiful a woman is to flatter her? What about the men who buy women drinks and beg them for dates and call them incessantly and tell them how they’re always thinking about them? Those guys are being honest about their intentions and their feelings, but they’re not getting anywhere, are they?

Here’s the problem: human nature is such that we don’t trust people who like us if we don’t feel as though we earned it somehow. Imagine if some “stranger came up to you, started complimenting you incessantly, buying you things, how would you react?

You’d probably think to yourself, “OK, what’s this guy selling?” Or maybe, if he was particularly pushy and weird, “Jesus, is this guy an ax murderer?”

That’s because they’re showing how invested they are in your approval without them actually knowing you, without them taking the time to connect with you and understand you. And as a result, you don’t trust them. You find them creepy and weird.
Welcome to every day of an attractive woman’s life.

Men like this are broadcasting their neediness like a giant neon billboard coming out of their ass. They come up and gush to a woman about how amazing she is while they’ve only known her for 10 seconds. They buy her things with only knowing her for a few hours. What this man is signaling to her is, “I don’t know you, but I’m already going to do anything to win your approval, that’s how desperate I am.” And it comes across as pathetic.

And even on a deeper level, what these men are sub-communicating is something else: “The only value I have to offer as a man is money and compliments. I have nothing else going for me.”

__A man with an attractive and interesting lifestyle, a man with high standards for himself and the relationships in his life, will take the time to get to know an attractive woman before soliciting her with gifts. He will wait until he feels strongly enough to genuinely give her a compliment. And if he talks to her and discovers that there is little that is interesting about her beyond her looks, then he will lose interest.__

Ironically, it’s these high standards and self-regard that women pick up on and find incredibly sexy. And it’s these same standards and self-regard that most men spend a lot of time trying to fake.

When in doubt, check your intentions.

Think about it: the average guy at the bar who goes around buying cute girls drinks — why is he buying them? So the girls will sit there and talk to him. 

When he comments on how beautiful they are and how he’s so infatuated with them, why is he complimenting them? So that they’ll like him. When he pays for fancy dinners and offers to buy them jewelry, why is he doing it? So they’ll be impressed with him and not leave him.

These are not gifts or compliments at all. These are deals he’s brokering. The terms may be implied or unspoken, but they’re transactions all the same. Everything he gives to her, he is giving with the expectation to receive something in return. The drinks are not unconditional. They’re bought with the provision that she stays and talks to him. The compliments are spoken with the provision that she shows him affection in return.

And when the women don’t show appreciation or don’t reciprocate interest, he becomes furious, blaming the women for being gold-digging, lying whores and bitches. Again, being a “nice guy” is never much different than being a narcissist. One only gives. The other only takes. But both are the same in their desperation for approval.

This is a subtle form of manipulation and, therefore, at its core, dishonest.

Once again, most high value, confident women will see through this immediately and not hang around a man who does this. In fact, the only women who will go for a man like this are women who are superficial and willing to trade their affection for material and superficial gain — these women are soulless and suppress their emotions as much, if not more than the men who buy things for them.

An attractive man expresses his interest unconditionally, expecting nothing in return. This arouses women and when they do reciprocate his interest, their interest is, in fact, a gift in return.

True honesty is only possible when it is unconditional. The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift — when nothing is expected in return. When I tell a girl that she is beautiful, I say it not expecting anything in return. Whether she rejects me or falls in love with me isn’t important in that moment. What’s important is that I’m expressing my feelings to her _in that moment_.

I don’t use my compliments as a bargaining tool. I give them unconditionally. A needy man will give a woman a compliment without knowing her and wait expectantly for her to repay him in either her company or with thanks or with sexual favors. I will give compliments only when I am honestly inspired to give them, and usually after already meeting a woman and displaying to her that I’m willing to disagree with her, willing to be rejected by her and willing to walk away from her if it ever comes to that. This willingness to walk away from her and this ability to accept nothing in return is what gives my genuine interest so much value.

When a compliment comes from a man seeking nothing in return, it’s a gift of truth, a piece of his vulnerability and infinitely more powerful as a result.

And this honest compliment inspires women to become more highly invested in return. Paradoxically, seeking no investment from her will inspire her to invest that much more in you.

Beautiful women are complimented on their looks often, and 99% of these compliments are given out of neediness, out of some idealization of who she is or what she can do for him.

Beautiful women have been conditioned for most of their lives to know when a man is being genuine or not, whether the compliment is a gift or a bartering tool.

And when it is a gift, when it is honest, she recognizes and appreciates a man who genuinely appreciates her. These men are rare.

Women are people too (radical idea, I know). And as people, we all value those who genuinely value us, not expecting something in return.

The biggest aphrodisiac in the world is someone who likes you, genuinely likes you. A woman’s desire is to be desired. But it has to be genuine desire. It can’t be a, “I’ll desire you as long as you “boost my ego and impress my co-workers,” kind of desire.

The point is that genuine no-strings-attached appreciation is rare in this world, particularly from men. Women value this and invest themselves in the rare man who can demonstrate his vulnerability to her.

Here’s the litmus test. Look at your actions and words around women and look at the intentions behind them. These intentions are always speaking ten times louder than your actual words. What are they saying?

If you bought a girl a drink so that she wouldn’t leave to talk to someone else, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested in her and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you told a girl a story in order to impress her and make her like you, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you invited a woman to a restaurant in order to impress her with how much money you had, what does that intention say about you? It says you were over-invested and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman’s attention or affection through entertainment, money or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.

I should add that these aren’t all-or-nothing propositions either. Look, we all want people to like us, and we all like to impress others. We all need some validation sometimes. We all do these things to certain degrees. It’s impossible to be perfectly non-needy all the time.

But neediness is relative. That’s why I say it’s about being less invested in others’ perceptions instead of NOT invested in others’ perceptions. It’s an important difference.

I’m not advising to become a heartless sociopath. Quite the opposite, really. Because the more you invest in yourself, the freer you will become to care for others around you without looking for anything in response. A man who is needy and does not invest in himself is ultimately only capable of superficial interactions because his threshold for vulnerability is so low.

It’s impossible to be completely devoid of investment in other people. That’s how we’re wired. But it is always possible to invest and care about yourself more.

### Setting Boundaries

But delivering honesty unconditionally isn’t just about compliments and appreciation. Unconditional honesty can be brutal and scathing at times as well. And strangely enough, brutal and angry honesty can turn a woman on just as much as the most genuine compliment.

Again, it’s not about what’s being said, it’s about the intention and sub-communication behind it. 

When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when you feel that she’s out of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate in your life, this sub-communicates the most powerful elements of attraction to her. Far more powerful than an entertaining story or game.

This is why it’s quite possible to piss a woman off and turn her on at the same time. Any man experienced with women will be familiar with this.

If a beautiful woman says something that a needy man finds offensive, he’ll ignore it, change the topic, or withhold his true feelings. Hell, he might even pretend to go along with her for fear of making her upset.

__But a non-needy man will tell her what she just said was offensive. Let the chips fall where they may. He won’t be an asshole about it. He will simply draw a line in the sand, “I don’t like stuff like that,” and she can choose to step across it or not.__

Narcissistic men often misconstrue this as a free ticket to tell people they’re always wrong or to basically do what they want without paying attention to the feelings of others.

That’s over-compensation and actually the behavior of someone who is over-invested and validated by the reactions of those around him.

A non-needy man does not seek to impose himself on the boundaries of others, he’s merely interested in maintaining his own boundaries while respecting the boundaries of others.

__Non-neediness means you respect yourself AND others. Narcissism means you only respect yourself. Neediness means you only respect others.__

The difference is that if a woman says something offensive, a narcissistic man will berate her and try to get her to change her mind, whereas a non-needy man will simply make it clear that he found what she said offensive and will not tolerate it again. How she responds is her choice.

If a woman insults a non-needy man’s friends, he will not hesitate to tell her to stop and stand up for those he cares about. If a woman says she needs to “leave a date after 30 minutes, he will not try to trick her into staying or beg her to come back, he will not yell at her or lecture her on manners. He will smile and say, “Nice meeting you,” and let it go.
Hold your line. Don’t go around breaking somebody else’s.

Most questions or problems men email me with, at their core, somehow involve a failure to maintain their boundaries. Whether it’s about a date, a woman not calling him back, a woman making fun of his job, or whatever, his perceived “problem” is simply him not stepping up and telling her what he’s willing to accept and not willing to accept in his relationships.

Typically it has to do with something like the following: “She really liked me and gave me her number. She responds to my texts, but when I tried to get her out on a date, she made excuses. So then I texted her some more and she said she wanted to see me, but when she did show up for the second date, she was late and said she had to go early. She didn’t kiss me. Now I’m texting her and she’s texting back but won’t agree to go on a third date. What do I do?”

Usually, men like this are obsessive about “the games women play” or how to deal with “tests” from women.

My answer to these men is always the same: if you make it clear from the beginning that you are unwilling to put up with games, then not only will the women you attract stop playing games, but you’ll stop attracting women who do.

In the example above, my plan of action? I would have said to her, “Let me know when you’d like to get together again. If you’re not interested, that’s fine too.”

Yes, I will actually say this to her. Not in a harsh manner. But in a clear manner.

I’ve said something similar to women probably 5-10 times. Without exception, they’re completely stunned. Often, they immediately apologize and say that they didn’t mean to be so flakey. Oddly enough, my honesty and complete willingness to be rejected (or to reject them) demonstrates my non-neediness and often it causes them to become more attracted to me.

And a couple times, they’ve said, “You’re right. I don’t want to date you,” in so many words. And that’s OK. Yeah, it hurt to hear that. But a lot of shit in life hurts. Get over it. It’s for the better. She just saved us both a lot of time and effort.

Your ability and willingness to establish boundaries is inversely proportional to how needy you are. Men who are needy and lack vulnerability will keep their boundaries loose and open, inviting manipulation into their lives and allowing people to walk over them. This is because they are more than willing to alter themselves in order to receive validation from the women they meet.

Men who are non-needy establish strict boundaries because they value their own time and happiness more than receiving attention from a woman. They also see no reason to trample over other people’s boundaries.

When it comes to making yourself more vulnerable, the first step is often to begin establishing your own boundaries. Learn how to say no to people, particularly women. Start having opinions on what you like and don’t like, what you’ll tolerate and won’t tolerate. Be honest with yourself, painfully honest. And then be painfully honest with her.

The problem with forming strong boundaries is that in order to form them, you have to be particularly aware of your own desires and emotions. And many men who have been needy their entire lives are not very self-aware. They don’t know what they’re willing to stand up for and what they’re willing to let slide. They don’t know their own emotional motivations and desires.

Men will often have to spend a lot of time seeking truth within themselves first before they’re able to express it to others.

### Finding Your Truth

It’s important to look at the reasons why you’re over-invested around women and have an honest discussion with yourself about it to try and resolve it.

For instance, perhaps you’re over-invested around women because you’re a virgin and have no experience with them. Then you need to look at how being inexperienced is causing you to undervalue yourself and seek validation. You must become comfortable with the idea of being inexperienced and be comfortable admitting that insecurity if you wish to gain a lot of experience.

Or perhaps your ex-girlfriend left you for another man and you’re bitter. Before you can undo the anger that is causing you to be over-invested, you need to come to terms with why you’re angry and accept why your ex left you.

For me, a big part of this was accepting that, actually, I had been a pretty naive and shitty boyfriend to my ex-girlfriend and I could understand why she would want to leave me. I also recognized flaws and insecurities in her that I hadn’t noticed when we were together and that she hadn’t been the perfect angel that I assumed she was. All in all, I came to terms with the experience and the anger receded, allowing me to let go and become less invested in women I dated.

Another example is a guy who has never been “cool” before. Perhaps he was picked on growing up and made fun of all through high school. Maybe the popular guys in school told him he was gay and a pussy.

Perhaps now he’s older, better looking and more social and is looking to compensate for all of those years of feeling insignificant. So he does it by throwing money around and attracting a lot of superficial attention. He’s having fun, but he’s scratching that itch, he’s finally living out that need to be the cool and popular guy. But at some point, he has to come to terms with this, accept it, and become comfortable admitting it. Then he can move on.

Again, if you’re only trying to get women to impress other guys, then you’re not in a very good place, and you need to take a serious look at your motivations. To undo this, you must come to terms with why you’re seeking attention and approval from other men — maybe it goes as far back as your father — and then seek to find that approval through other means. Join a sports team. Take your co-workers out for beers. Buy season tickets to the local basketball team. There are much healthier ways to get male camaraderie than to try and impress other guys by getting girls.

As you’ll see, the book is divided up into three core areas: building a congruent and attractive lifestyle for yourself, overcoming your fears and anxieties, and becoming socially adept at expressing your emotions and sexuality without shame or hesitation.

### Friction and Projection

Attraction is great, but in and of itself, it’s not always enough to consummate a romantic or sexual relationship.
There are two main reasons that prevent attracted women from being with you, and they are both quite common: I call them friction and projection.

Friction is when a woman finds you to be an attractive man, but there are value differences or external circumstances that prevent her from acting on that attraction or being interested in you.


The most common case is the girlfriend/wife. This happens all the time. You meet a woman, you two really click, she’s laughing at all your jokes, smiles when you smile, looks into your eyes a little bit too long…
…and she’s married.

Friction can be religious, cultural or simply due to poor logistics.

Ultimately, your values determine your behavior. And that’s kind of the point of all of this: YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think others want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship.

Projection is completely different. There are a lot of women who, for whatever reason, are afraid of their own sexuality and/or openly sexual men. They harbor trust issues and resentment with men. Usually, this is because they have a history of some sort of emotional/sexual abuse and/or they’ve experienced a long string of disappointments with the men in their life.

When confronted with a non-needy man — a man without these similar emotional hang-ups and distrust — these women will usually be untrusting and lash out in response. They are not lashing out for lack of attraction, but they are lashing out because they are attracted and that strong sexual attraction scares them, particularly if you’re a man who feels threatening to them. Their view of male sexuality is negative and when they are confronted with an honest and attractive man they’ll often attack you and try to tear you down for it.

These are the women who will get angry and say snide things like, “I bet you say that to all the girls,” or will find reasons to push you away and then regret it and want you back. They will pretend to miss your calls and then get angry when you don’t persist in calling them, or they’ll make up excuses to ignore you on a date and then get mad when you don’t behave like a gentleman.

Needless to say, you’re better off without these women. Take the rejection and move on.

Generally, these women are extremely needy, and because of the large investment gap between you two, they will try to project their own investment onto you. They will accuse you of being demanding, overbearing, too horny, untrustworthy, or weak. These accusations will have little to no connection to reality, and a non-needy man will either walk away from a girl like this or simply ignore her accusations if they have no bearing.

The only men willing to put up with such nonsense are men who are highly needy as well. The needy man will spend all of his time placating and trying to fix the accusations and problems the woman projects onto him. And the most messed up part about this is that the needy man will enjoy fixing and placating the needy woman. The needy man enjoys it because this constant “fixing” of the distrusting woman’s fears and accusations makes the needy man feel needed.

If the man is narcissistic, then he will usually lash out right back at the woman and they will engage in a relationship full of petty, unimportant drama, playing out emotions and projecting their histories of pain and marginalization onto each other over and over again, until one of them finally becomes conscious enough to break the cycle and move on. Sometimes this happens quickly. Other times it takes months or years. Either way, it’s always unpleasant.

The uncomfortable truth is that the majority of women are going to have high degrees of friction and projection when you meet them. With most of the women you meet, things are simply not going to work no matter what you do or say. This is to be expected. And this is fine. You are going to be incompatible with most of the women in the world and to hold any hopes of being highly compatible with most is an illusion of grandeur and a figment of your own narcissistic tendency.

Incompatibility is a fact of life. No matter how you behave or what you’re into, the majority of women out there at any given time are simply not going to be interested or emotionally available to you. Our job is not to attract every woman, but to screen for women with a high potential of being attracted to who we really are.

The reality of incompatibility defines our entire strategy of dating women. To base our strategy on anything else is inefficient at best and downright damaging at worst. The world is what it is, it’s our job to simply present ourselves as boldly and clearly to it as possible, accept the reactions and move on the opportunities. Any attempt to control the reactions of others or take some kind of power over the reactions you receive is both foolish and illusory.

# Part II: Strategy

# Chapter 4 : Polarization

A lot of dating advice, particularly of the performance variety, tries to promise the ability to have sex with any girl you want, regardless of... well, pretty much anything. You could be a fat slob living in your mother’s basement, and with the right two or three lines, you too can date a lingerie model (as if there’s a lingerie model hanging out on every street corner).This is a fairy tale. And not only is it a fairy tale, it’s a fairy tale you don’t actually want to live. It feeds your neediness. __Rejection exists for a reason — it’s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.__

Again, the men who are needy and have poor self-esteem are the ones who are willing to completely alter their personalities in order to seduce any woman. The first step to being more attractive is to see rejection as a means to eliminate women who won't make you happy from your life. It's a blessing, not a curse.

So let’s start at the beginning. There are an infinite number of women out there, and we can’t possibly meet or even know all of them. So our first task is to find a way to narrow them down and screen them in a way that we can manage our opportunities better.

### The Three Categories of Women

For practical purposes, we can divide up all of the women you’re attracted to into three categories: Receptive, Neutral and Unreceptive.

Women who are Unreceptive are just that: they’re unavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you. The most common reasons that put women in this category are the following:

* You’re far needier than she is, and she’s therefore not attracted to you
* She has a boyfriend/husband and is happy in her relationship.
* There’s too much friction preventing her from being willing to date you, such as a difference in values, difference in interests, bad logistics, etc.
* She’s not interested or looking for any man at the moment.

__The way to tell if a woman is Unreceptive is if she repeatedly does not reciprocate your signs of interest and/or shows you signs of disinterest.__ If you invite her out for coffee and she keeps making excuses to why she can’t, then she’s Unreceptive. If you call her three times and she never calls back, then she is Unreceptive. If you chat her up and she explains that she is busy and wants to be alone, then she is Unreceptive. __If you hang out with her and she talks about how frustrated she is with her boyfriend and how you’re such a good listener, then she’s Unreceptive.__

No exceptions. Many men waste a lot of time convincing themselves that Unreceptive women may actually like them. A good rule of thumb here is, “if you have to ask, then that’s your answer.” That is, there should be no ambiguity here. And if there is, you can quickly solve it by simply stating to her, “I think you’re cute/pretty/attractive/funny/whatever, want to grab coffee/dinner/a drink sometime?”

Problem solved. You’ll find out where you are very quickly.

But I’m getting ahead of myself…

The next category is Neutral. This category can be difficult for men to understand because it’s not as common for us as it is for women. Typically, a man knows within a few seconds if he’s willing to meet and even sleep with a woman or not.
Women aren’t like that. They spend a lot of time being unsure about a man and need to be swayed one way or the other.

__Women in this category are usually women who you’ve just met or have only spent a little bit of time with. The important thing to know is that women do not ever stay in this category. They eventually polarize one way or the other. And if you never make an advance or show interest in them, then they will usually polarize towards being Unreceptive (this is the Friend Zone, which we’ll cover in a minute).__

Neutral women are generally just that, neutral. They will not necessarily turn down your offers, but they won’t offer or reciprocate themselves. The jury’s still out. They’ll often tentatively say yes, although they won’t seem overly enthusiastic about it. They’re still testing the waters. Or sometimes, they just haven’t considered you in that way yet.

The goal with Neutral women is to polarize them through your words and behaviors. This may mean flirting with them or teasing them. It may mean asking her on a date. It may be as simple as smiling at her from across the room. Whatever it is, the goal with Neutral women is to take an action that forces her to make a decision about how she feels about you. Which side she polarizes to is far less important than actually taking action. And remember, if you leave her to her neutrality, she will usually become Unreceptive and not see you as dating material.

And in the final category, women who are Receptive are women who are sexually/romantically attracted to you. You can recognize women who are Receptive in two ways: 1) they initiate with you, and/or 2) they reciprocate your actions enthusiastically.

Some examples of a woman initiating with you:

* She makes strong eye contact with you and doesn’t break it.
* She approaches you.
* She touches you unprovoked.
* She asks for your number or invites you out with her/her friends.
* She asks you a lot of questions about yourself and seems genuinely interested in you.
* She introduces you to her friends.
* She gives you her number.
* She comes up with some excuse/story/reason for you to hang out with her or spend time with her.

Chances are if you’re reading this book, many of the girlfriends or sexual experiences you’ve had with women in the past only happened because she initiated with you.

That’s fine. But just going about your life, unless you are extremely good-looking or have a great life style or you manage to meet women through good social contacts, few women are going to initiate with you and the few who do won’t initiate often.

In fact, most women, especially very beautiful women, even if they’re attracted to you, won’t initiate with you. Remember, women tend to be less invested before sex, therefore, they (usually) expect men to initiate in the beginning. There are also strong cultural pressures on women to wait for the man to initiate.

The other way women demonstrate that they’re Receptive is when they reciprocate. It’s important to recognize the subtle difference between a woman reciprocating your advances and a woman being neutral toward your advances. A woman who is Neutral will simply not respond at all. For instance, if you touch a Neutral woman on her back while you speak to her, she’ll just act like you’re not touching her.

A woman who is reciprocating will do something to respond positively to your advance. Think of it as her signaling to you that she accepts your advancing on her and likes it. If you touched a woman on the back and she wanted to reciprocate, she would either lean back into you, lean in closer to you, or touch you in return.

Here are some other common examples of reciprocation:

* She ignores her friends to stay and talk to you.
* She keeps very strong eye contact and laughs a little too much at everything you say.
* When you touch her, she touches you in return.
* When you put your arm around her, she leans into you.
* When you take her hand to move somewhere, she holds it in return.
* When you ask her out on a date, she offers a place to go or mentions something she’d like to do with you.

Most interested women will reciprocate on small signals to show that they’re interested in you. Catching on to how women reciprocate and noticing the signals is something that you develop with experience, but it shouldn’t be too hard if you know what to pay attention to.

A lot of the methods of flirting that we’ll cover in Part V will address the specific ways in which women reciprocate and how to handle them.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of women you will meet, assuming you’re a typical guy, will be either Neutral or Unreceptive. This is true for the most of the male population, myself included, so don’t worry.
The percentage of women that you meet in each category will vary widely from man to man and also vary widely depending on the context in which you meet women.
