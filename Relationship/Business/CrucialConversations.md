Crucial Conversation: A discussion between two or more people where :

(1) stakes arehigh  
(2) opinions vary  
(3) emotions run strong.  


When conversations matter the most-that is, when conversations move from casual to crucial-we're generally on our worst behavior. Why is that? We're designed wrong. When conversations tum from routine to crucial, we're often in trouble. That's because emotions don't exactly prepare us to converse effectively. Countless generations of genetic shaping drive humans to handle crucial conversations with flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent persuasion and gentle attentiveness.


So here's the audacious claim. Master your crucial conversations and you'll kick-start your career, strengthen your relationships, and improve your health. As you and others master highstakes discussions, you'll also vitalize your organization and your community.
